### CCA Leaders

CCA Leaders have a burning passion for their CCAs and possess a zeal to ensure that their CCA excel. They have a strong sense of responsibility towards their CCA and a deep attachment to their seniors, juniors and peers. Within the school, CCA Leaders are acknowledged as significant leaders and good role models. Collectively, they also come together to serve the school by planning for programmes on a school level.
