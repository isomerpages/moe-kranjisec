### Peer Support Leaders

Kranji Secondary School believes that Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) play an important role in the ecosystem of support for students’ mental well-being, as students tend to prefer to first approach their peers when they face challenges. Hence, it is vital to ensure that the selection of PSLs is stringent and rigorous.
