### Houses
  
Since the start of the school in 1995, the Kranji House system was created to foster team spirit, a sense of loyalty and belonging in students and teachers in the house and to the school at large. This is done via friendly competition and numerous House-related activities. Students and teachers contributes points to their own Houses. At the end of the year, the House with the most number of points will be crowned the Overall Champion House!

The 6 Houses are based on the letters of the school name: K R A N J I. Each House is represented by an animal mascot and its House colour.
