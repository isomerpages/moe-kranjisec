Made famous in a poem, the albatross shall live up to its reputation as the troublesome burden – to others! With its tremendous wingspan, sometimes exceeding 3.7 metres, the massive albatross will easily impress by sheer size and unsurpassed gliding power. Known also for its stamina and endurance in long distance travelling, the albatross is ever ready to go **“BEYOND THE LIMITS”**

An Albatross aloft is a spectacular sight! Made famous in a poem, the Albatross lives up to its reputation as the troublesome burden – to outsiders! With its formidable wingspans, sometimes exceeding 3.7 metres, the impressive Albatross will easily ride the ocean winds and sometimes glide for hours without rest or even a flap of its wings. This is how we are as the Albatross House. We are truly resilient and we don’t give up when the going gets tough. We continue to fight on no matter what the outcome is.  
  
Young Albatrosses may fly within three to ten months after they are hatched, this shows that Albatross House members are fast-learners and we adapt very quickly depending on the situation. We learn from mistakes and pick up new skills and knowledge along the way so that we can anticipate and overcome future challenges.  
  
The Albatross impresses not just by sheer size but by its unsurpassed gliding power. We are known for our stamina and endurance in long distance travelling. We soar high to catch and ride the wind. The Albatross is ever ready to go “**BEYOND THE LIMITS**”.
