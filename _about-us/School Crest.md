### School Crest

     style="width:60%">

The school logo portrays a complete circle with pillars within it. Two of the pillars break through at the top right edge of the circumference.

  

#### Chilli Red and Dark Green Background Colour

The Red represents the youthful dynamism of our pupils and the Green symbolises their sense of responsibility and respectful attitude. Green also represents growth and development.

  

#### Five Pillars and Breaking of Circle’s Circumference

The five pillars represent the five shared national values1 that the school wishes to inculcate in the pupils. The break though on a segment of the circle’s circumference symbolises determination and perseverance to excel in academic and co-curricular activities through the shared efforts of students, teachers, parents and the community.

  

#### Green Circular Shape

The basic circular green shape indicates the school’s emphasis on the all-round development of the individual student and the school’s commitment to create opportunities for their intellectual, moral, physical, social and aesthetics development through its instructional, enrichment programmes and co-curricular activities.

*1 Five Shared National Values are : 1) Nation before community and society above self, 2) Family as the basic unit of society, 3) Community support and respect for individual, 4) Consensus not conflict, and 5) Racial and religious harmony.*
