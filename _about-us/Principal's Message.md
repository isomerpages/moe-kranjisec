### Principal's Message

**Dear Parents, SAC, Alumni, Staff and students,**

<img src="/images/principal.png" style="width:183px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> Kranji Secondary School was founded in 1995 and through the efforts of School Advisory Committee members, School Leaders, staff, Parent Support Group members, alumni and our partners, the school has firmly established itself to be a school of choice and is now a well-regarded member of our community. 

  

2017 and 2018 were years in which we seized the opportunity during PRIME to review, consolidate and plan for Kranji Secondary School’s next milestone in her history. It is with great joy and energy that we continue in our journey as a school to Mould the Future of Our Nation with a renewed drive in developing our students to become _Thinkers, Leaders and Champions._

We will continue to consolidate the good work done in preparing our students to be future-ready through our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Learning for Life Programme (LLP) and Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme. Our ALP aims to equip our students with the necessary life skills by nurturing them to be reflective and independent learners through a Thinking Curriculum. Through our LLP in Student Leadership and our VIA Programme, we aim to strengthen the Singapore Spirit amongst our students, so that we can take great strides toward realising our vision of nurturing _Leaders with a heart to serve, and Thinkers with the drive to excel_. I would also like to encourage all to look forward and participate actively as we strive to strengthen the Kranjian Identity through our revised House system starting from 2019! 

Guided by our school motto Breakthrough, I am confident that Kranjians will put forth their best and develop the essential dare and can-do spirit so as to achieve successes for their future. It is my conviction that together with our passionate and caring staff, all Kranjians will experience learning that is distinctive, meaningful and joyful.
