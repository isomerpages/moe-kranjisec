### Returning Singaporeans And International Students

Admission for International Students

International students (i.e. non Singapore citizens) seeking school placement in Singapore will need to undergo the Admission Exercise conducted by Ministry of Education (MOE). For more information, please refer to: https://www.moe.gov.sg/international-students/admission

If your child is aged 7 to 7+ and above as of 1 January in the year of admission, they can seek admission to the education level appropriate for their age through either of the following:

*   Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS).  
    The AEIS is for admission to Primary 2 to 5 and Secondary 1 to 3 for the following academic year.
*   Supplementary Admissions Exercise for International Students (S-AEIS).  
    The S-AEIS is for admission to Primary 2 to 4 and Secondary 1 to 2 for the same academic year.

Admission through AEIS or S-AEIS is not guaranteed, and is subject to your child's performance in the tests. If successful, placement will be based on the available vacancies in our schools and your declared residential area, where possible.

## Returning Singaporeans

Returning Singaporean children are Singapore Citizens (SC) or Singapore Permanent Residents (SPR) children who are:
*   going overseas to live and study;
*   currently living and studying overseas; or
*   returning home having lived and studied overseas.
    

If your child has a place in a secondary school under the Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme, he/she can re-join his/her former school immediately upon return. If your child is not on LOA, and is seeking admission to secondary schools, you may consider the following school admission options:
