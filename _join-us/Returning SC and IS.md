### Returning Singaporeans

  
Returning Singaporean children are Singapore Citizens (SC) or Singapore Permanent Residents (SPR) children who are:

*   going overseas to live and study;
*   currently living and studying overseas; or
*   returning home having lived and studied overseas.

  

If your child has a place in a secondary school under the Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme, he/she can re-join his/her former school immediately upon return. If your child is not on LOA, and is seeking admission to secondary schools, you may consider the following school admission options:
