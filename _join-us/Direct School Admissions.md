#### Additional Information

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to 
* honour their commitment to the school, and 
* participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.

**Please note that:**

Students successfully allocated to their DSA-Sec schools will NOT be allowed to participate in the annual S1 Posting Exercise to opt for secondary schools, and are expected to honour the commitment to the allocated DSA Sec school for the entire duration of the programme.
