<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>The Direct School Admission Exercise for Secondary School (DSA-Sec) allows

Examination (PSLE).</p>
<p>We are accepting applications for DSA-Sec in the following categories:</p>

<p></p>
<p>Please also take note that meeting all the criteria does not guarantee
the student will be shortlisted/given an offer.</p>
<p>Applicants who do not have prior experience may also apply. The school
will assess applicants based on the selection criteria, which may include
assessing the potential of the applicants.</p>
<h5>Application Timeline</h5>

<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic

the area of talent.</p>

to</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; honour their commitment
to the school, and</p>

related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students successfully allocated to their DSA-Sec schools will NOT be allowed

and are expected to honour the commitment to the allocated DSA Sec school
for the entire duration of the programme.</p>
