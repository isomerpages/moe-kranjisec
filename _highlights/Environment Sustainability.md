### Biodiversity Learning Hub @ Kranji

Kranjians’ efforts to raise awareness about the richness of Singapore’s biodiversity is brought close to home through the creation of the Biodiversity Learning Hub in Kranji. The Biodiversity Learning Hub provides tactile, hands-on learning experiences for Kranjians. First, the Biodiversity Learning Wall serves as an educational corner providing a detailed overview of Kranji’s ALP outcomes, highlighting and explaining the core Thinking Routines, as well as our biodiversity conservation and awareness efforts. Second, an edible garden has been established in the Native Garden. This garden was built by our teachers and students, and will be used to raise awareness of the importance of sustainability. This integrated learning hub will create experiential learning experiences for Kranjians, and will eventually be used during community outreach efforts to educate the other schools in the estate about local biodiversity.
