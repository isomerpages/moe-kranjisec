As part of our West Zone’s efforts in supporting ICT developments, Kranji Secondary School prides itself as a champion for Cyber Wellness and our students have been facilitating the annual **Cyber Wellness Student Ambassador** workshop for all West Zone secondary school students since 2017.  

The objectives of organizing this workshop are as follows:

*   to engage CWSAs in peer advocacy through discussions and implementation of cyber wellness activities
*   to equip CWSAs with facilitation skills and questioning techniques that enable them to engage their fellow school mates (participants)
*   to guide CWSAs to design Cyber Wellness activities that leverages on ICT for effective delivery and learning

The rich discussion at the workshop enabled students to formulate ideas on a particular Cyber Wellness topic. This allowed for greater learning among course participants as well as facilitators which they can practice back in their own schools.

The workshop provided good opportunities to enhance students’ knowledge and enabled them to acquire skills like collaboration, communication and independent learning, prepares them for lifelong learning and the challenges ahead.

Kranji Secondary School is collaborating with ASEAN Studies Centre, a research think tank of The Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS), to co-host a four-part series of discussion sessions. This collaboration is planned to tap on the Centre’s expertise to share and sharpen our students’ understanding of issues affecting ASEAN.  
  
With the theme, “ASEAN Youths in Climate Action”, student participants from Kranji Secondary and 3 other secondary schools in our W6 Cluster would benefit from a deeper understanding of sustainable development and climate action in ASEAN, including Singapore which recently launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030. The students would also learn more about one of the fastest growing regions in Asia, which would help them better seize opportunities from ASEAN’s growth in future.  
  
There are a total of four discussion sessions, one in each school term, which would be conducted via Zoom. The details of the sessions are as follows:

| Session 	| Topic & Focus 	|
|:---:	|:---:	|
| 1 	| Envisioning: What do youths want for ASEAN? 	|
