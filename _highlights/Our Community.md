### Mid-Autumn Festival @ Limbang

The Mid-Autumn Festival @ Yew Tee is an annual community event jointly organised by the Limbang Grassroots Organisations and Kranji Secondary School. Students from the Student Council, Mother Tongue Department, Symphonic Band, Modern Dance Club, National Police Cadet Corps and St John Brigade came together with the Limbang residents and Mr Lawrence Wong (Former Minister for National Development and Second Minister for Finance) to celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival through fun games and cultural performances.

Our student leaders from the Student Council formed part of the Organising Team, planning and implementing game booths to promote community bonding and engagement. They brainstormed for game ideas based on Mid-Autumn traditions and presented them to representatives from the Limbang Grassroots Organisations. Students from NPCC set up a scam prevention game booth which was extremely popular with residents.
