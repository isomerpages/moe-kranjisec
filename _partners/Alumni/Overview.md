Formed in 2016, we are a team of passionate pioneer alumni who aimed to set up an alumni to serve as a key strategic partner in our alma mater. On 10 July 2019, the Kranji Alumni is formally registered as an association under the Registry of Societies to better support and contribute to Kranji Secondary School strategically.  

#### Mission

*   To support the school’s initiatives and development by tapping on the experience and expertise of Alumni members.
