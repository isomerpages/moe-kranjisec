### Applied Learning Programme

#### Design Innovation for Sustainable Living

The Applied Learning Programme in Kranji Secondary School, Design Innovation for Sustainable Living, aims to allow students to learn a user-centric lens in analysing authentic sustainable living issues, identify opportunities for improvement and design creative solutions to address the user needs. The ALP focus on sustainable living deepen students’ knowledge on nine of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) covered in the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which have been broadly categorised into three broad areas11 – Physical Environment, Resource and People.

*¹ The nine SDGs are categorised into three broad areas:  
(1) Physical Environment – SDG 13 Climate on Action, SDG 14 Life Below Water, SDG 15 Life on Land  
(2) Resource – SDG 2 Zero Hunger, SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation  
(3) People – SDG 7 Affordable & Clean Energy, SGD 3 Good Health and Well-being, SDG 4 Quality Education and SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production

##### Desired Outcomes of our ALP

Through the programme, students will

*   develop knowledge and skills to work collaboratively with peers to design innovative solutions to address issues on sustainable living
*   practise sustainable living efforts at personal level, and champion sound sustainable living initiatives in school and at the community level
*   readily explore post-secondary pathways in sustainability-related industries

  

##### Our Approach and Programme

The desired outcomes will be achieved through the following:

#### Think INquire in Kranji (THINK) Programme

     style="width:60%">

The THINK programme functions as an innovative and safe space for students to exercise independent and collaborative learning, such that they are able to create user-centric solutions to address sustainable living issues.  

The THINK Programme spans over one year, from Semester 2 of Secondary 1 to Semester 1 of Secondary 2.  

In the THINK Programme, students:

*   Learn the stages in Design Thinking and relevant Thinking Routines to find solutions to sustainable development problems
*   Acquire Research and Information Literacy Skills that help them thrive in this information age
*   Develop communication and collaborative skills by engaging in an inquiry project

  

Students are guided to develop and improve on their proposed solutions, and they are provided with the opportunity to pitch their proposed solutions at the THINK Carnival, sharing their innovations with the rest of the school.

#### Green Ambassador Programme

The Design Thinking approach acquired by students through THINK Programme forms the backbone in enabling Kranjians to lead in areas of sustainable living to champion a cause. Biodiversity outreach and education efforts were seeded by our Green Ambassadors, who aspire to advocate for biodiversity conservation through youth and public engagement in biodiversity trails.

In conjunction with NParks Biodiversity Week for Schools 2021, the Green Ambassadors lead Lower Secondary and Primary students from other schools in a biodiversity virtual trail in Kranji Marshes to broaden their scale of impact to other youths in Singapore. The virtual programmes allowed our Green Ambassadors to continue with their Biodiversity outreach and education efforts amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Green Ambassadors had also developed biodiversity trail packages in three different parks (Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Labrador Nature Reserve and Coney Island Park) for the Secondary 1 Express and NA students as part of an informal learning experience.

#### Greening School for Biodiversity Programme

Kranjians’ efforts to raise awareness about the richness of Singapore’s biodiversity is brought close to home through the creation of the Biodiversity Learning Hub in Kranji. The Biodiversity Learning Hub provides tactile, hands-on learning experiences for Kranjians. First, the Biodiversity Learning Wall serves as an educational corner providing a detailed overview of Kranji’s ALP outcomes, highlighting and explaining the core Thinking Routines, as well as our biodiversity conservation and awareness efforts.

Secondly, a bee-friendly habitat has been established in the Garden by our teachers and students, in partnership with National Parks Board (under the Greening School for Biodiversity Programme). Pollinator-attracting plants and bee hotels are introduced into the garden. The bee hotels, designed for solitary bee to make their nests, are constructed by our students and they help in attracting more bee pollinators into our garden to ensure the flourishing our plants in the garden. This garden will be used as an outdoor classroom to raise awareness of the importance of sustainability and as a ground for ecological studies to deepen students’ understanding of the complex interactions in nature.

#### Sustainability-related Research Programme

In 2021, under the guidance of a research mentor from Science Centre Singapore and teacher mentors from our school, a group of secondary 2 students embarked on a research project to investigate the sound absorption capabilities of different types of food waste. Students carried out the experiment and applied their critical thinking skills and scientific knowledge to analyse the results that they obtained. The students present their findings to a panel of judges at the Hwa Chong Institution’s (HCI) annual Project’s Day and was awarded “High Distinction in Project Work” for their immense effort.

Another group of secondary 3 students worked under the guidance of a scientist from the Institute of Chemical Engineering & Sciences, A\*STAR, to explore the harvesting of hydrogen fuel from food waste.
