### Internationalisation Programme

#### “The World is my Classroom”

Kranji Secondary School’s Internationalisation Programme aims to equip all Kranjians with a global perspective. With globalisation, the need to possess multi-cultural literacy becomes increasingly important. The driving force behind Kranji Secondary School’s Internationalisation Programme is the board concept of experiential and authentic learning. Through “The World is my Classroom” concept, the international exposure provides opportunities for our students to engage in real-world application of knowledge, skills and values.

The Ministry of Education has featured our e-internationalisation programmes on schoolbag, a news website that provides parents, educators and the general public with education news, school features and tips. The article “The World is my Classroom” narrates our school’s approach in continuing to provide our students with an international experience despite the COVID-19 situation and the rich learning that student participants had obtained from this programme. Read the article [here](https://www.schoolbag.edu.sg/story/the-world-in-my-classroom)!

This award recognises and affirmed our school's efforts in securing varied learning opportunities for our students despite disruptions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### “ASEAN Youths in Climate Action” discussion series

Former Education Minister Ong Ye Kung announced at the 2020 Committee of Supply Debate on the need for our students to understand ASEAN better and be equipped to take on new opportunities from ASEAN’s growth. In partnership with ASEAN Studies Centre, a research think tank with the Institute of South East Asian Studies (ISEAS) in Singapore, Kranji Secondary co-organised a four-part webinar series of discussion sessions for 65 students in 2021, including students from our cluster schools. The theme for 2021 is “ASEAN Youths in Climate Action”. These sessions are planned to allow the Centre to share and sharpen our students’ understanding of issues affecting ASEAN. This would further augment and strengthen students’ understanding and exposure towards Asia, in particular the ASEAN region, beyond the MOE enhancement and coverage in the Humanities curriculum.
