### Art and Crafts

Established in 2016, **Art and Crafts** provides both breadth and depth to facilitate Kranjians’ Arts appreciation. Kranjians engage in the Arts through visits to museums, take part in competitions and participate in various workshops to gain knowledge, skills and dispositions. They take ownership to be advocates of Art. With the knowledge gained, Art Club members take the initiative to lead Art programmes to impact the community. With that, we celebrate their achievements through exhibitions and static displays to showcase their talent.

This year, Art Club participated in _SYF goes Online_ to create a representation of how technology has impacted our lives. Despite the COVID-19 situation, Art Club continued its activities via online platforms. The members participated in making mosaic coasters to show their appreciation to the support staff during Teacher’s Day 2020. As part of the extension of the Applied Learning Programme, they made ceramic tiles inspired by our flora and fauna in Kranji Marshes. Upon the resumption of CCA, members took part in mural painting to commemorate Singapore’s 55th National Day. Undeterred, Art Club members continue to harness their talents during these unprecedented times.
