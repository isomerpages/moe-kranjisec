### Kranji Modern Dance Club

**Kranji Modern Dance Club (KMDC)**Â strives to develop well-rounded dancers and maximise the potential of each dancer, with exposure to different genres such as Contemporary, Jazz, Hip-hop and Ballet dances. The dancers are also given opportunities to work with different external instructors and choreographers to broaden their horizon and enrich their movement vocabulary, as well as given training in choreography techniques and make up skills.

KMDC is known for its great discipline and camaraderie, and functions at a high level of self-efficacy and student autonomy. There is immense focus on positive learning attitude and character development of every dancer, on top of skills acquisition and performance quality, to enable them to push their limits and achieve greater heights. There are multiple platforms for the dancers to perform on stage, such as the annual year end Dance Camp Showcase, school and community events and biennial public concert during non-SYF years. KMDC has also participated in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation in 2 categories since 2013, International Dance and Chinese Dance, with outstanding achievement over the last 5 years. With a strong following of alumni who return regularly to support the club, KMDC has grown from strength to strength, and continues striving for all-round development and excellence in all its undertakings.
