Formed in 2020, the **Kranji Chinese Dance Society (KCDS)** aims to cultivate an appreciation for the Chinese culture through the learning of Chinese dance. With a team of experienced instructors, we focus on developing and strengthening our dancers’ skills and techniques and nurturing them into skilful and graceful Chinese dancers who exude confidence and exhibit good showmanship when dancing. Through rigorous training and various performance opportunities, we provide our dancers with the platforms to be more adept in the art of Chinese dance. In addition, we strive to build their character by inculcating self-discipline, perseverance and team spirit.
