### Science and Technology Club

The **Science and Technology Club** is a newly established club that aims to nurture science enthusiasts into passionate and inquisitive thinkers through science research and problem solving. Through thoughtfully designed and selected club activities, our club members undergo CCA training that equips them with the skills and knowledge that enable them to develop scientific dispositions such as scientific literacy, communication and critical thinking skills that support research and encourage curiosity, innovation and creativity. A diverse selection of STEM workshops and challenges are provided for our club members to extend their scientific capabilities and interest. They are also encouraged to develop coding and programming skills through workshops and various programs. Through committing their time for research and taking part in competitions, our club members will learn valuable 21st CC skills such as relationship management and resilience. In addition, they are given plenty of opportunities to hone their leadership and character development through mentoring their juniors, leading club events and planning and organising of school science-related events.
