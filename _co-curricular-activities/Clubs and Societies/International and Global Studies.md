### International and Global Studies

Designed to cultivate students’ interest and engage them in the societal and global issues, the **International and Global Studies (CCA)** exposes students to interdisciplinary learning experiences beyond the classroom. The wide array of activities allow students to cultivate global perspectives. A global perspective gives our students the skills to solve problems, think critically, and find ways to build collaboration at a local and global level.

Through their 4 years of active participation in the CCA, students are able to:  

*   deepen their understanding of the society and global community;
*   nurture into critical thinkers and responsible global citizens; and
*   develop their leadership and personal capabilities.

Students hone their skills and knowledge through various activities such as learning journeys, popular films critique, map making and participation in local and overseas competitions and conferences. As leaders of Humanities-related events, students have opportunities to lead in school-wide events such as the annual Humanities Amazing Race Programme (HARP), Humanities Week etc. which will enable them to apply and showcase their learning and leadership competencies.

In 2020, the pioneering batch of students led their respective classes as facilitation guides for the Internal Security Department (ISD) exhibition. Through this learning experience, students practised their public speaking skills and shared their knowledge about the potential threats to Singapore society with their classmates.

In 2021, students participated in in the Garbage Archaeology Online Programme organised by TemasekHistory Research Centre (THRC), where they learn about the importance of documenting and interpreting artefacts in archaeology. They also took part in the Ginowan-Kranji Online Exchange where they collaborated with Japanese students from Ginowan Senior High School to discuss and present on thevarious Sustainable Development Goals. Through these initiatives, students are exposed to current global issues and have broadened their perspective through their participation in these activities.
