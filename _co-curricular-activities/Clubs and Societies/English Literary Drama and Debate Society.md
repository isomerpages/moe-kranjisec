The **ELDDS** is a vibrant and dynamic club with confident and fun-loving members who are articulate in expressing their emotions and feelings. The CCA has two main focuses: Drama and Debate.

  

Through drama, members are provided with a well-rounded experience of theatre. Students are exposed to a vast array of theatre skills such as voice projection, articulation, scripting, stage managing and lighting design. Members also have the opportunity to watch performances for wider exposure about the craft. ELDDS has attained excellent results at the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging and Arts Presentation over the years, and also taken part in performances at regional libraries as part of Fairytale Trails.

  

Members in debate have the opportunity to receive training, to teach them how to develop persuasive arguments. Members take part in the Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships as well as informal sparring sessions with debaters from other schools. Debaters develop their cognitive and persuasive skills through these sessions, which also teach them how to present ideas convincingly.

  

With a dedicated team of teachers and instructors looking into high quality training, there are ample opportunities given to the members to showcase their abilities and their own works in scripting, acting, debating and hosting events as emcees. The members form a motivated, versatile and creative team that strives to hone its craft to continually improve with each performance.
