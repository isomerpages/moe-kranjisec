### Table Tennis

The **Table Tennis** team is an all-girls team. It consists of disciplined and resilient players who are motivated to achieve good outcomes. They level up their skills through their rigorous training sessions, sparring sessions with peers, and friendly matches with other schools. Every year, they will take part in the west zone table tennis tournament and friendly matches. Opportunities are provided for students with leadership potential to hone their skills.
