<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To develop a dynamic team of teachers and students with a passion for
mathematics.</p>
<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<p>The Mathematics Department engages students in meaningful learning through
the application of mathematics to real-world contexts. Lessons are designed
to develop students’ analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. Beyond
the classroom, students’ learning experiences are enriched through <strong>STEM-related activities</strong>,
where they explore the connections between Science, Technology, Engineering
and Mathematics in authentic problem-solving settings. To further stretch
and challenge our students, we provide opportunities for them to hone their
mathematical thinking through participation in various competitions such
as the <strong>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad</strong> and the <strong>Australian Mathematics Competition</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>ICT- Infused Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>Personal Learning Devices empower students to take ownership of their
learning by allowing them to learn at their own pace and explore topics
more deeply. Through collaborative online platforms, students work together
to investigate mathematical problems, share ideas and develop solutions
collectively. This approach nurtures self-directly learning in our students.</p>
<p><strong>Real-World Applications of Mathematics and STEM lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>Incorporation of real-world learning experiences&nbsp;into lessons enables
students to acquire and understand Mathematics while seeing the relevance
of the subject in the world around them. Through STEM-infused lessons,
students develop the 3Cs (Be Curious, Be Creative, Be the Change). The
students then use these skills to work on real world problems.</p>

<p><strong>Code for fun</strong>
</p>
<p>The Code for Fun Programme, a joint initiative by IMDA and MOE, aims to
increase students’ exposure to coding and computational thinking. In <strong>Secondary 1</strong>,
students are introduced to basic coding logic through interactive and hands-on
activities. In <strong>Secondary 2</strong>, they explore the world of <strong>Generative AI</strong> and
its practical applications.</p>
<p>These programmes provides authentic opportunities for students to apply
mathematical concepts such as <strong>spatial visualisation</strong>, <strong>data handling and analysis</strong> as
well as <strong>geometry and measurement</strong>. Through these experiences,
students develop creative and logical thinking skills that strengthen their
appreciation of how mathematics connects to technology and the real world.</p>

<p><strong>Mathematics Competitions</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are given opportunities to participate in a range of <strong>local and international mathematics competitions</strong>,
where they are exposed to the rigours of competitive problem-solving. These
experiences challenge them to apply mathematical concepts creatively, think
critically under pressure, and develop perseverance and confidence in tackling
complex problems.
