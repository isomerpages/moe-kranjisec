<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To develop a dynamic team of teachers and students with a passion for
mathematics.</p>
<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<p>The Mathematics department engages students in the learning of mathematics
using real-world applications of mathematics in lessons. We enrich students’
learning experiences by providing various enrichment activities such as
Mathematics Trail and <strong>STEM</strong> (<strong>S</strong>cience, <strong>T</strong>echnology, <strong>E</strong>ngineering, <strong>M</strong>athematics)
Week. In addition, we provide opportunities for students to hone their
mathematical problem-solving skills in various competitions such as the
Singapore Mathematical Olympiad and Australian Mathematics Competition.</p>

<p><strong>ICT- Infused Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>The Personal Learning Devices allow students to learn at their own pace
and to collaborate with each other online. Students also have the opportunities
to investigate mathematical problems with their friends and work out the
solutions together.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Real-World Applications of Mathematics and STEM lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>Incorporation of real-world learning experiences&nbsp;into lessons enables
students to acquire and understand Mathematics while seeing the relevance
of the subject in the world around them. Through STEM-infused lessons,
students develop the 3Cs (Be Curious, Be Creative, Be the Change). The
students then use these skills to work on real world problems.</p>

<p><strong>Code for fun</strong>
</p>
<p>The Code for Fun Programme is a joint initiative by IMDA and MOE to increase
students’ exposure to coding and computational thinking. In Secondary 1,
students are exposed to simple coding logic. In Secondary 2, students are
exposed to Generative AI and their uses. The programme provides opportunities
for students to be engaged in learning mathematical skills such as Spatial
Visualization, Data Handling and Analysis, Geometry and Measurement. Students
will use microcontrollers, basic drag and drop coding and cardboard Lego
Blocks known as Blokies to build different physical structures based on
their understanding of <strong>STEM</strong> to solve real world problems.</p>

<p><strong>STEM Week</strong>
</p>
<p>During STEM week, students participated in level activities that are interdisciplinary
to use the knowledge and skills from different disciplines to work on small
projects.</p>

<p><strong>Mathematics Competitions</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are given the opportunity to participate in various&nbsp;competitions
held locally and internationally to expose them to the&nbsp;rigours of
competitive Mathematics.&nbsp;
