<h2>ICT</h2>
<h3>Our Goals</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Empowering Self-Directed Learners</strong>: We aim to nurture
students who take charge of their own learning journey. They will possess
the ability to question, reflect, and persist in their pursuit of knowledge.
Through the use of digital tools, they will be intrinsically motivated
to monitor and manage their learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fostering Collaborative Learners</strong>: Collaboration is a
vital skill in today's world. Our students will learn to work harmoniously
with others, building upon each other's knowledge to achieve common learning
objectives. They will also embrace diverse perspectives, enhancing their
ability to explain their reasoning and decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cultivating Responsible Citizens</strong>: We want our students
to actively contribute to the information pool in online communities while
adhering to proper etiquette. Additionally, they will be adept at verifying
the accuracy, credibility, and currency of information from multiple sources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology In Action Sessions</h3>
<p>In this digital age, traditional teaching methods may not fully engage
tech-savvy students. Our role as educators is evolving towards facilitating
self-directed and collaborative learning and technology is a crucial tool
for achieving this. The Technology In Action sessions are designed to promote
experimentation and innovation through the effective use of ICT in classroom
teaching.</p>

<h3>ICT Blasts by ICT Champions</h3>
<p>Our ICT Champions send out ICT Blasts every two weeks to encourage experimentation
and innovation in the integration of ICT into classroom teaching. These
resources serve as supplements for staff, providing valuable insights and
motivation for teachers to incorporate technology more meaningfully into
their lessons.</p>

<h3>ICT Programme for Secondary 1</h3>
<p>In line with the MOE National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) where
the focus will be acquiring digital skills across four main components
- Find, Think, Apply and Create, we planned for all Secondary One students
to undergo Minecraft Education Sustainability' training. This training
will teach them how to apply design thinking concepts to Minecraft Education
and create sustainable living structures. Students will collaborate in
groups to build their sustainability structures, eventually integrating
them to form a sustainability city as a class. These skills are essential
for various projects assigned by subject teachers.</p>

<h3>ICT Programme for Secondary 2</h3>
<p>Kranji Secondary commenced the offering of <strong>O-Level Computing</strong> from <strong>2023 as an option in our Secondary 3 Subject Combination</strong>.</p>
<p>To cultivate students’ interest in computing and the opportunity to be
exposed in Python programming as part of a deeper appreciation for ICT,
‘Coding with Python’ workshop was offered since 2022 for all Secondary
2 students. The workshop was conducted online and includes the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>use of Python programming to design data analytics models;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hands-on and experiential project-based learning; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>application on mathematics computational thinking</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students use the online version of Python to familiarise themselves with
syntax-based programming concepts, including understanding Python language
syntax, developing basic capabilities to explore and learn about Python
data analytics models, and understanding coding fundamentals such as loops,
events, conditionals and variables.</p>
<h2>O-Level Computing</h2>
<p>Kranji Secondary began offering O-Level Computing from 2023 as an option
in our Secondary 3 Subject Combination.</p>
<p>The O-Level Computing subject is catered for students who display passion
and/or talent in Computing. It focuses on developing problem-solving and
Computational Thinking Skills in support of 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies
as well as an appreciation of intellectual property and ethical issues
arising from the use of technology. Students who offer the subject will
also gain a head-start if they decide to take up computing-related studies
or pursue computing-related careers in the future.</p>

<h3>Objectives of Programme</h3>
<p>The O Level Computing syllabus aims to provide students with the foundation
to pursue further studies in computing at A-Levels and at tertiary institutions.
The skills acquired in computational and algorithmic thinking is a way
of getting to a solution through clear definition of the steps leading
to solutions. These skills are needed to embrace a rapidly changing technological
landscape.</p>
<p>The two-year course at upper secondary level will equip students to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Apply logical reasoning and algorithmic thinking in analysing problem
situations and developing solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop simple programs through the use of appropriate programming language(s)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand how and where information communications technology (ICT) is
used in daily life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand and explain the ethical, social and economic issues associated
with ICT</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ICT refers broadly to technology involving computing devices, software
and other hardware. The computer science concepts and skills will also
be taught.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Eco-system to cultivate students’ interest in computing</h4>
<p>Currently, the school has an eco-system to build and cultivate students’
interest in computing. The school has a CCA in Science &amp; Technology
Club with diverse selection of STEM workshops and challenges are provided
for students to extend their scientific capabilities and interest and to
develop coding and programming skills.</p>
<p>In addition, the Code for Fun Programme is offered as a post examination
enrichment to all Sec 1 students to increase their exposure to coding and
computational thinking. This is part of a set of mathematical enrichment
activities designed to nurture students’ interest in STEM and to develop
their disposition in STEM. Students will use microcontrollers, basic drag
and drop coding and cardboard Lego Blocks known as Blokies to build different
physical structures based on their understanding of mathematical/STEM skills
such as spatial visualisation, geometry and measurement. For example, they
will write a program to create a house intruder system for their ‘house’
made from Blokies.&nbsp;</p>
