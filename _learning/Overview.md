### Lower Secondary

We are one of the secondary schools implementing Full Subject-based Banding.

Students will be placed in form classes with a mix of students from different courses (e.g. Express, N(A), or N(T)), so that they can interact with students of different strengths and interests.

Students will also be offered subjects (English, Mathematics, Science, Mother Tongue) at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary 1, based on their PSLE AL Score for each subject.
