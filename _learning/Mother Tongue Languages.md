<h4>Vision:</h4>
<p>Learn to love the language • Love to learn the language</p>
<h4>Missions:</h4>
<p>To nurture Kranjians to love and appreciate their Mother Tongue Languages;</p>
<p>To help them to stay rooted in traditions and values;</p>
<p>To prepare them for a changing world.</p>
<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<p>In alignment with Strategic Thrust 1 for <strong>nurturing future-ready learners</strong>,
the Mother Tongue Curriculum is tailored to meet the diverse learning needs
of all student groups. These programmes fall under a three-tier approach
in our Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L) Framework: <strong><em>Core</em></strong><em>, </em><strong><em>Enrich</em></strong><em>, and </em><strong><em>Aspire</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Under Tier 1, <strong><em>Core</em></strong>, the MTL department utilises
the News Reading Programme to integrate global and national issues into
classroom lessons. Students read MTL news articles assigned by their teachers
through SLS Newslink or <a href="http://zbschool.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">zbschool.sg</a> (CL). Subsequently, MTL teachers
conduct weekly discussions on these news articles to expose students to
current affairs and promote global awareness.</p>
<p>We have designed self-paced Digital Literacy SLS lessons to encourage
independent learning among students. These lessons cover New Media Literacies,
which encompass competencies for curating, connecting, and creating information
in the digital networked environment (e.g., oral assessment), as well as
productivity skills for effective device and software operation (e.g.,
email response typing skills).</p>
<p>The MTL department is also working on a Professional Learning Team to
create an e-gamification lesson package on SLS, aiming to enhance the students'
learning experiences by using game design principles to make learning more
engaging.</p>
<p>Under Tier 2, <strong><em>Enrich</em></strong>, the MTL department organises
MTL fortnight programmes to immerse students in Mother Tongue languages
and cultures. These activities provide authentic opportunities for cultural
learning, including tea appreciation workshops, drama appreciation, Wau
Batik painting, Silat, digital vlogging workshop, public speaking workshop,
traditional musical instrument workshops, traditional games and pottery
making etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, we were pleased to welcome television hosts and radio DJs from
Mediacorp Channel 8, RIA 897FM, and YES933, who shared valuable insights
into the media industry, motivating students to strive for excellence in
language and communication.</p>
<p>Through these activities, we aim to enrich our students' cultural and
language learning experiences.</p>

<p>As part of our school's ongoing internationalisation efforts, we have
established a partnership with Xingzhi Junior Middle School in Hangzhou,
China, since 2015. Secondary One to three students have participated in
synchronous conference sessions, fostering a deeper understanding of the
global community through interdisciplinary approaches. The exchange sessions
enable students from both schools to share insights on culture, customs,
the Asian Games, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), environmental conservation
issues, and more.</p>
<p>In May 2024, we hosted students and teachers from Hangzhou Xingzhi Junior
Middle School, providing an opportunity for both schools to engage in meaningful
cultural exchanges. Their visit included school tours, classroom lessons,
and participation in our Cross-cultural Immersion Programme, where they
explored Bunga Manggar Art and Rice Rangoli Art.</p>

<br>Under Tier 3, <strong><em>Aspire</em></strong>, the development of Kranjians’
talents is approached in various ways, including involving students in
writing, editing, emceeing, performing, and submitting work for creative
Chinese essay compilations such as the 'Kspiration' 《憧憬》 publications.
We also organise an Author-in-Residence programme, where we invite local
writers to conduct workshops to hone our students' creative writing skills.</p>
<p>Additionally, selected students are given opportunities to participate
in various competition and workshops to go beyond syllabus requirements.</p>
