<h4>Vision:</h4>
<p>Learn to love the language • Love to learn the language</p>
<h4>Missions:</h4>
<p>To nurture Kranjians to love and appreciate their Mother Tongue Languages;</p>
<p>To help them to stay rooted in traditions and values;</p>
<p>To prepare them for a changing world.</p>
<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<p>In alignment with Strategic Thrust 1 for <strong>nurturing future-ready learners</strong>,
the Mother Tongue Curriculum is tailored to meet the diverse learning needs
of all student groups. These programmes fall under a three-tier approach
in our Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L) Framework: <strong><em>Core</em></strong><em>, </em><strong><em>Enrich</em></strong><em>, and </em><strong><em>Aspire</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Under Tier 1, <strong><em>Core</em></strong>, the MTL department utilises
the News Reading Programme to integrate global and national issues into
classroom lessons. Students read MTL news articles assigned by their teachers
through SLS Newslink or <a href="http://zbschool.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">zbschool.sg</a> (CL). Subsequently, MTL teachers
conduct weekly discussions on these news articles to expose students to
current affairs and promote global awareness.</p>
<p>We have designed self-paced Digital Literacy SLS lessons to encourage
independent learning among students. These lessons cover New Media Literacies,
which encompass competencies for curating, connecting, and creating information
in the digital networked environment (e.g., oral assessment), as well as
productivity skills for effective device and software operation (e.g.,
email response typing skills).</p>
<p>The MTL department is also working on a Professional Learning Team to
create an e-gamification lesson package on SLS, aiming to enhance the students'
learning experiences by using game design principles to make learning more
engaging.</p>
<p>Under Tier 2, <strong><em>Enrich</em></strong>, the MTL department organises
MTL fortnight programmes to immerse students in Mother Tongue languages
and cultures. These activities provide authentic opportunities for cultural
learning, including tea appreciation workshops, drama appreciation, Wau
Batik painting, Silat, digital vlogging workshop, public speaking workshop,
traditional musical instrument workshops, traditional games and pottery
making etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, we were pleased to welcome television hosts and radio DJs from
Mediacorp Channel 8, RIA 897FM, and YES933, who shared valuable insights
into the media industry, motivating students to strive for excellence in
language and communication.</p>
<p>Through these activities, we aim to enrich our students' cultural and
language learning experiences.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To stimulate students' curiosity in languages, we also promote the MTL
&amp; EL Readership Programme to cultivate a reading culture in both their
mother tongue languages and English within the Kranjian community. Additionally,
the department organises various events, such as Lunar New Year Celebrations,
Hari Raya Celebrations, and Deepavali Celebrations, to help students learn
beyond the classroom and strengthen their cultural heritage and identity.</p>

<p>As part of our school's ongoing internationalisation efforts, we have
established a partnership with Xingzhi Junior Middle School in Hangzhou,
China since 2015. This year, Sec One and Two students have participated
in synchronous conference sessions, fostering a deeper understanding of
the global community through interdisciplinary approaches. The exchange
sessions enable students from both schools to share insights on culture,
customs, Asian Games, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), environmental conservation
issues, and more.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we had the pleasure of hosting a school visit from Shifang
Middle School from Sichuan, China. Our school has been engaged in the school
exchange programme with Shifang Middle School since 2010, and it was truly
heartwarming to welcome them back after the brief hiatus during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Under Tier 3, '<strong>Aspire</strong>', the development of Kranjians;
talent is approached in various ways, including involving students in writing,
editing, emceeing, performing, or submitting for creative Chinese essay
compilations such as the 'Kspiration' 《憧憬》 publications. We also organise
an Author-in-Residence program, where we invite local writers to conduct
workshops to hone our students' creative writing skills.</p>
<p>Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) opportunities related to MTL subjects,
such as contemporary issue debates in Chinese and Traditional Chinese Calligraphy,
are provided to broaden horizons. Additionally, selected students are exposed
to numerous competition and workshop platforms to go beyond syllabus requirements.</p>
