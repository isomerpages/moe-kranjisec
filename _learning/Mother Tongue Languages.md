#### Missions:

To help them to stay rooted in traditions and values;

To prepare them for a changing world.
 
####  Key Programmes

In alignment with Strategic Thrust 1 for nurturing future-ready learners, the Mother Tongue Curriculum is tailored to meet the diverse learning needs of all student groups. These programmes fall under a three-tier approach in our Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L) Framework: **Core**, **Enrich**, and **Aspire**.

Under Tier 1, '**Core**', the MTL department utilises the News Reading Programme to integrate global and national issues into classroom lessons. Students read MTL news articles assigned by their teachers through SLS Newslink or zbschool.sg (CL). Subsequently, MTL teachers conduct weekly discussions on these news articles to expose students to current affairs and promote global awareness.

We have designed self-paced Digital Literacy SLS lessons to encourage independent learning among students. These lessons cover New Media Literacies, which encompass competencies for curating, connecting, and creating information in the digital networked environment (e.g. oral assessment), as well as productivity skills for effective device and software operation (e.g. email response typing skills).

The MTL department is also working on a Professional Learning Team to create an e-gamification lesson package on SLS, aiming to enhance the students' learning experience using game design principles to make learning more engaging.

Under Tier 2, '**Enrich**', the MTL department organises MTL fortnight programmes to immerse students in Mother Tongue languages and cultures. These activities provide authentic opportunities for cultural learning, including tea appreciation workshops, traditional Chinese games, Wau Batik painting, Silat, Indian traditional musical instrument workshops, and pottery making. Through these activities, we aim to enrich our students' cultural and language learning experiences.**

The department also organised several events, such as Pongal Festival, Lunar New Year Celebrations, Hari Raya Celebrations and Deepavali Celebrations. These activities have enabled students to learn beyond classroom context and strengthen their sense of cultural heritage and identity.

In Tier 2, ‘**Enrichment**’, the MTL department developed an e-book that extensively encapsulates a detailed explanation of 6 different ethnic festivals, highlighting the significance of symbols and practices in order to address students’ misconceptions of festivals celebrated by the different ethnic groups in Singapore. For this innovation, our team aims to adopt Blended Learning using Student Learning Space (SLS) as a platform in order to optimise students’ learning. Sec 1 students accessed the e-book on their own and attempted the quizzes provided at the end to self-assess their understanding of the content provided in the e-book. They are also required to complete the SLS Oral package encompassing reading assessment, video submission, peer evaluation and post-survey as part of the alternative assessment. The following are some video presentations of our Sec 1 students in the role of a book promoter!

In Tier 3, '**Aspire**', Talent development is planned and carried out with the department taking varied approaches in providing opportunities to develop students to their fullest potential. For example, the department offers opportunities to students who show interest in stretching their potential in the subject by involving them in roles such as writing, editing, emceeing and performing for creative CL essay compilation - Kspiration publications and launch. We also provide selected students the exposure through numerous competition and workshop platforms to stretch students beyond meeting syllabus requirements.

**CL:**<br>
National Creative Story Writing Competition, Author-In-Residence Programme, World Book Day and Literature under the April Sky

**ML:**  <br>
