<p>The Humanities Department is dedicated to developing leaders with a heart
to serve and thinkers with the drive to excel through a curriculum that
emphasises inquiry-based learning across the humanities disciplines. Through
inquiry-based learning, we empower students to engage deeply with historical,
geographical, and social issues, helping them become informed and responsible
citizens in an interconnected world.</p>
<h2>Key Humanities Programmes</h2>
<h5>Social Studies Issues Investigation, Geographical Investigation &amp; Historical Inquiry</h5>
<p>The Social Studies Issues Investigation project is a collaborative and
inquiry-based group project that allows students to delve into allocated
social issues and propose viable solutions. Through this project, students
are encouraged to gather evidence from their interviews with the various
social service agencies to support their proposed solutions to help the
less fortunate in society. In addition, the skills acquired during this
project are applied in a real-world context when students plan their class-based
VIA projects. Students choose from a diverse range of social service agencies
that focus on similar social causes and apply what they have learnt in
the project to craft appropriate engagement opportunities with the agencies'
beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Geographical Investigation and Historical Inquiry provide platforms for
Kranjians to conduct authentic historical and geographical research beyond
the classroom. Through such inquiry-based approaches, all Geography and
History students exercise and develop self and relationship management
skills, which are important for life.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Model United Nations Conferences</strong>
</p>
<p>The Model United Nations is an academic simulation of the United Nations
Conference that aims to educate upper secondary student participants about
current and international affairs. Students from different local and international
schools will play the roles of delegates representing their assigned countries
in councils of their choice, engage in simulated UN debates regarding global
issues. They have the opportunity to hone their public speaking, reasoning,
research and interpersonal skills, enabling them to come up with plausible
and creative solutions to their assigned issue. The Model United Nations
is a good platform for Kranjians to deepen their understanding of the complexities
of international relations in our highly globalised world.</p>
<p><strong>MOE History Challenge</strong>
</p>
<p>The MOE History Challenge aims to engage History students in the disciplinary
aspects of History where students can demonstrate their knowledge of the
subject and apply conceptual understanding across different periods through
a quiz.</p>
<p><strong>National University of Singapore Geography Challenge</strong>
</p>
<p>The National University of Singapore (NUS) Geography Challenge is a competition
that aims to engage, empower and educate Geography students on local and
global issues. Through exploring the relevance of Geography in our daily
lives, students have the opportunity to deepen their knowledge and hone
their skills in geographical fieldwork and techniques.&nbsp;</p>
