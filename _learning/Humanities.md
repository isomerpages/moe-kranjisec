The Humanities Department believes in the transformative power of a humanities education to develop our students into analytical, critical and creative thinkers. We prepare our students for the challenges of the changing world by nurturing students into active global citizens, and lifelong learners and leaders.

## Key Humanities Programmes

##### Social Studies Issues Investigation, Geographical Investigation &amp; Historical Inquiry

The Social Studies Issues Investigation project is a collaborative and inquiry-based group project that allows students to delve into allocated social issues and propose viable solutions. Through this project, students are encouraged to gather evidence and case studies from other countries to support their proposed solutions. In additional, the skills acquired during this project are applied in a real-world context when students plan their class-based VIA projects in the from August 2023. Students choose from a diverse range of social service agencies that focus on similar social causes and apply what they have learnt in the project to craft appropriate engagement opportunities with the agencies' beneficiaries.

Geographical Investigation and Historical Inquiry provide platforms for Kranjians to conduct authentic historical and geographical research beyond the classroom. Through such inquiry-based approach, all Geography and History students exercise and develop self and relationship management skills, which are important for life.

**The Model United Nations Conferences**

The Model United Nations is an academic simulation of the United Nations Conference that aims to educate upper secondary student participants about current and international affairs. Students from different local and international schools will play the roles of delegates representing their assigned countries in councils of their choice, engage in simulated UN debates regarding global issues. They have the opportunity to hone their public speaking, reasoning, research and interpersonal skills, enabling them to come up with plausible and creative solutions to their assigned issue. The Model United Nations is a good platform for Kranjians to deepen their understanding of the complexities of international relations in our highly globalised world. 

**MOE History Challenge**

The MOE History Challenge aims to engage History students in the disciplinary aspects of History where students can demonstrate their knowledge of the subject and apply conceptual understanding across different periods through a quiz.

**National University of Singapore Geography Challenge**

The National University of Singapore (NUS) Geography Challenge is a competition that aims to engage, empower and educate Geography students on local and global issues. Through exploring the relevance of Geography in our daily lives, students have the opportunity to deepen their knowledge and hone their skills in geographical fieldwork and techniques.
