## Objectives&nbsp;

Science@Kranji aims to develop students who are Inspired by Science, Inquire like Scientists and Innovate using Science. With a renewed focus on **S**cience, **T**echnology, **E**ngineering and **M**athematics (STEM), we envisage students who are passionate about STEM and equipped with the necessary competencies to solve complex real-world problems in future.&nbsp;

### STEM Learning Experiences and Enrichment

What are the principles for building a thermal box? What is the difference between hydroponics and aquaponics? Can I use my knowledge in Chemistry and create an effective fertiliser for Bok Choy?

We believe that Science is more than the acquisition of knowledge; it is also a way of thinking and doing. Hence, we adopt the inquiry-based learning approach and focus on teaching the Practices of Science. The questions above are some examples of the problems that our students work on as part of the Science@Kranji curriculum.

As enrichment, Secondary 1 students were all involved in the maintenance and growth of various greens in our very own hydroponics and aquaponics set ups. The resulting vegetable harvests were given fresh to the residents around Limbang.

Secondary 2 students were given the chance to participate in different STEM enrichment workshops during the enrichment week programme based on their interests to learn about cloud chambers, chocolate making, soap making, forensic science, and environmental disaster etc.

All students also participated in STEM Week challenges. Through these experiences, students learnt about useful real-world applications of science to extend their knowledge from the classroom.

### Research and Competitions&nbsp;

Interested students are provided with opportunities to take part in Science Research and participate in numerous competitions and science fairs, such as the C.B. Paul Quiz, Singapore Junior Biology, Chemistry, Physics Olympiads, Illustratum Physics Competitions, National Crystal Growing Challenge, Elementz International Fair and the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair. Under the mentorship of teachers or scientist-mentors from the Science Centre and A\*STAR, students are guided to learn about scientific knowledge beyond the curriculum, apply their knowledge to solving problems, plan and carry out scientific investigations as well as showcase and communicate about Science.

### Internationalisation

Two groups of Secondary 3 students participated in exchange programmes with Triam Udom Suksa Pattanakarn Suvarnabhumi (TUPP) in Thailand, and Tu Cheng High School in Taiwan, working on cross-school collaborative projects to identify problems and ideate solutions relating to UN Sustainable Development Goals. These programmes develop studentsâ€™ awareness of global sustainability issues, promote cross-cultural understanding and allow students to develop creative solutions using design thinking.
