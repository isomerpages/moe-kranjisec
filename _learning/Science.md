<p>Science@Kranji aims to develop students who are Inspired by Science, Inquire
like Scientists and Innovate using Science. With a renewed focus on <strong>S</strong>cience, <strong>T</strong>echnology,<strong> E</strong>ngineering
and <strong>M</strong>athematics (STEM), we envisage students who are passionate
about STEM and equipped with the necessary competencies to solve complex
real-world problems in future.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>STEM Learning Experiences and Enrichment</h3>
<p>What are the principles for building a thermal box? What is the difference
between hydroponics and aquaponics? Can I use my knowledge in Chemistry
and create an effective fertiliser for Bok Choy?</p>
<p>We believe that Science is more than the acquisition of knowledge; it
is also a way of thinking and doing. Hence, we adopt the inquiry-based
learning approach and focus on teaching the Practices of Science. The questions
above are some examples of the problems that our students work on as part
of the Science@Kranji curriculum.</p>
<p>As enrichment, Secondary 1 students were all involved in the maintenance
and growth of various greens in our very own hydroponics and aquaponics
set ups. The resulting vegetable harvests were given fresh to the residents
around Limbang.</p>

<p>...to community!</p>
<p>Secondary 2 students were given the chance to participate in different
STEM enrichment workshops during the enrichment week programme based on
their interests to learn about cloud chambers, chocolate making, soap making,
forensic science, and environmental disaster etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enriching lives through science</p>
<p>All students also participated in STEM Week challenges. Through these
experiences, students learnt about useful real-world applications of science
to extend their knowledge from the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Research and Competitions&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Interested students are provided with opportunities to take part in Science
Research and participate in numerous competitions and science fairs, such
as the C.B. Paul Quiz, Singapore Junior Biology, Chemistry, Physics Olympiads,
Illustratum Physics Competitions, National Crystal Growing Challenge, Elementz
International Fair and the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair. Under
the mentorship of teachers or scientist-mentors from the Science Centre
and A*STAR, students are guided to learn about scientific knowledge beyond
the curriculum, apply their knowledge to solving problems, plan and carry
out scientific investigations as well as showcase and communicate about
Science.</p>

<h3>Internationalisation</h3>
<p>Secondary 3 students participated in online exchange programmes with Triam
Udom Suksa Pattanakarn Suvarnabhumi (TUPP) in Thailand, and Tu Cheng High
School in Taiwan, working on cross-school collaborative projects to identify
problems and ideate solutions relating to UN Sustainable Development Goals.
These programmes develop studentsâ€™ awareness of global sustainability issues,
promote cross-cultural understanding and allow students to develop creative
solutions using design thinking.</p>
