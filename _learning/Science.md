## Objectives&nbsp;

Science@Kranji aims to develop students who are Inspired by Science, Inquire like Scientists and Innovate using Science. With a renewed focus on **S**cience, **T**echnology, **E**ngineering and **M**athematics (STEM), we envisage students who are passionate about STEM and equipped with the necessary competencies to solve complex real-world problems in future.&nbsp;

### STEM Learning Experiences and Enrichment

What are the principles for building a thermal box? What is the difference between hydroponics and aquaponics? Can I use my knowledge in Chemistry and create an effective fertiliser for Bok Choy?

We believe that Science is more than the acquisition of knowledge; it is also a way of thinking and doing. Hence, we adopt the inquiry-based learning approach and focus on teaching the Practices of Science. The questions above are some examples of the problems that our students work on as part of the Science@Kranji curriculum.

As enrichment, Secondary 1 students were all involved in the maintenance and growth of various greens in our very own hydroponics and aquaponics set ups. The resulting vegetable harvests were given fresh to the residents around Limbang.

### KEPLER Programme (See [KEPLER webpage](https://www.kranjisec.moe.edu.sg/future-ready-learning/Kepler/) for more details)&nbsp;

* **Academic Competitions, Research Programmes, Fairs and Conferences**

Interested students are provided with opportunities to take part in Science Research and participate in numerous competitions and science fairs, such as the C.B. Paul Quiz, Singapore Junior Biology, Chemistry, Physics Olympiads, Illustratum Physics Competitions, National Crystal Growing Challenge, Elementz International Fair and the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair. Under the mentorship of teachers or scientist-mentors from the Science Centre and A\*STAR, students are guided to learn about scientific knowledge beyond the curriculum, apply their knowledge to solving problems, plan and carry out scientific investigations as well as showcase and communicate about Science.

* **Tucheng-Kranji e-Internationalisation**

A group of Secondary 3 students participated in the virtual exchange programme with Tu Cheng High School in Taiwan, working on cross-school collaborative projects to identify problems and ideate solutions relating to UN Sustainable Development Goals. This programme develops studentsâ€™ awareness of global sustainability issues, promotes cross-cultural understanding and allows students to develop creative solutions using design thinking.
