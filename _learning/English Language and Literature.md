<p>The following is a summary of our key programmes that you may want to
read about:</p>
<h2>1. English Reading Programme</h2>
<p>Reading extensively is an integral part of language learning. The objectives
of the school’s English Reading Programme are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To develop good reading habits in students</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help students sharpen their language skills and broaden their general
knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enable students to widen their range of vocabulary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enhance students’ ability to generate and develop ideas for expository
writing and spoken interaction</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The department subscribes to a range of magazine titles for students.
The titles are selected based on their suitability for each level/stream,
considering the profiles and language competencies of students. Reading
time is set aside in the morning for students to do silent reading together
as a school. Apart from the assigned magazines, students are also encouraged
to read their own reading material on selected days during the morning
reading time.</p>
<p>
<br>Discussion of selected magazine articles is conducted during English lessons.
Thinking Routines are adopted as a key pedagogy to facilitate class discussion
of topics/issues featured in the magazine article. Thereafter, students
write an individual reading reflection piece on the magazine article, based
on guiding questions aligned to the Thinking Routine(s) employed during
the class discussion.</p>
<p>In our continued efforts to foster a strong reading culture in the school,
a series of fun and enriching reading-related activities and competitions
are organised for students to take part in. In addition, students are invited
to vote for books they would like to see in the school library and also
actively participate in the National Reading Movement.</p>
