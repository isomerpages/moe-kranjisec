<h1>The Aesthetics Department</h1>
<p>The Aesthetics Department encompasses four dynamic subjects: <strong>Art, Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T), and Nutrition &amp; Food Science (NFS) and Music</strong>.
Within these subjects, students embark on a journey of self-expression,
exploration, and practical application. From the visual realms of painting
and sculpture to the harmonious melodies of music, and the functional elegance
of design, to the science behind nutrition and food, our department offers
a diverse array of avenues for both artistic and scientific expression.
Students learn various skills such as prototyping, culinary &amp; food
science experimental skills, music and art making. They also learn project
management skills, creativity and empathy, through learning journeys, workshops,
community projects and competitions.</p>

<p>In addition to the four academic subjects, the department runs two key
programs—'Arts-experiences' and 'Kranji Got Talent'—to inspire students
to appreciate the beauty of the world and contribute through their unique
talents and perspectives.</p>
<h4>Artsperiences</h4>
<p>In 2024, the department launched a pilot initiative offering a variety
of workshops to cater to students' diverse interests. These aesthetic workshops
cover a range of activities, including sand art, ceramics making, drumming,
and more. Students can sign up for any workshop that appeals to their interests.</p>

<h4>Kranji Got Talent (KGT)</h4>
<p>Kranji Got Talent is an annual event that celebrates the diverse artistic
talents of our students. Each year, auditions bring excitement to the school
as students showcase their skills in areas like singing, dancing, DJing,
and more. The event provides a platform for aspiring performers while allowing
the school community to experience the vibrant and dynamic culture. Finalists
from the auditions have the opportunity to perform at major school events,
where they are met with enthusiastic support from both students and teachers.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Art Unit</u></strong></h4>
<p>Our Art Programme promotes creativity, self-expression, critical thinking,
and problem-solving. It equips students with 21st-century skills through
traditional and contemporary mediums, including painting, drawing, photography,
digital, and mixed media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Kranji Secondary, learning extends beyond the classroom, with students
participating in art competitions to gain experience and recognition for
their talents. Learning journeys to museums expose them to local and international
art, fostering a deeper appreciation for the arts and cultural heritage.</p>
<p>As students progress through Upper Secondary, they develop their skills
and explore personal themes through advanced projects. They engage in deeper
conceptual thinking when they learn more about mediums in depth. In preparation
for future opportunities, students are encouraged to develop their own
style and prepare portfolios.</p>

<h4><strong><u>D&amp;T Unit</u></strong></h4>
<p>Design and Technology (D&amp;T) focuses on nurturing creativity, design
thinking, and problem-solving skills. Through hands-on learning and prototyping,
students explore real-world challenges, applying concepts from STEM education
to develop innovative solutions. This subject encourages critical thinking
and empowers students to bring their ideas to life.</p>
<p>The unit also incorporates projects that utilize recycled materials, such
as using recycled bottles for creating mock-ups. This approach aligns with
our commitment to sustainability and supports the principles of a circular
economy, as well as the Singapore Green Plan 2030.</p>
<p>To complement the curriculum, students are exposed to various workshops
that develop their 21st Century Competencies (21CC) and participate in
design competitions to expand their understanding beyond the D&amp;T subject.</p>

<h3>Maker Programme</h3>
<p>For this year, the D&amp;T unit continues to have its in-house Maker Programme
to allow students tinkering their area of interest through hands-on activity
outside classroom learning. There is a Makerspace where students have an
opportunity to explore their own interests, learn to use hand tools and
machines and work with materials to develop creative projects.</p>
<p>The students gotten to design and make a coin box out of wood. In the
process, the students were guided by D&amp;T teachers and Technical Support
Officers (TSO) and the activity took place in term 2.</p>
<p>Students work collaboratively to design and make the prototype and through
this activity, these students discussed, make decision and solve any challenges
arose in the process. Not only they built confidence in the process, the
students really enjoyed themselves and took pride in their work upon completion.
Do keep a look out for the next Maker activities.</p>

<h3>Student Initiated-Learning, SLS (3D Printer)</h3>
<p>For this year, as part of Student-Initiated Learning (SIL), the D&amp;T
unit embarked on the designing and fabricating using the 3D printer. The
students were taught 3D digital app using the Paint 3D, converting the
final digitalised idea into the 3D printer for making. It was an exciting
journey for students who used the 3D for the first time in school.</p>

<h3>Design Camp@Temasek Polytechnic</h3>
<p>Our Sec 3 D&amp;T students attended the 2 days camp at Temasek Polytechnic
organised by the School of Design. The programme consists of talk on the
various courses in School of Design, hands-on activities such as sustainable
product development, risograph printing, silk screening of tote bags and
product development using Rhino software. There were also Ice breaking
games, station games and mass dance for the students from different schools
to bond and work together. It was an enriching experience for our students
to get insights on the possible design courses, school life at the Polytechnic
and to inspire them to work hard for their graduating year.</p>

<h2>Nutrition and Food Science</h2>
<p>The Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) unit aims to educate students with
knowledge in Nutrition &amp; Health, Food Literacy, Consumer Literacy and
Food Science. We aim to provide our graduating students with a foundation
that can be useful if they would like to pursue food sciences or other
food related courses during their tertiary education.</p>
<h3>Food Photography</h3>
<p>In 2022, we received our 1st batch of FSBB Secondary 1 students, with
a mixture of G1, G2 and G3 in the same class. We approach the students’
learning in FCE common curriculum using Differentiated Instructions (DI),
based on their readiness and pace of learning. The students worked on a
coursework project which required them to plan and prepare an attractive
and nutritious pancake dish for teenagers in school. Students applied their
knowledge of plating and garnishing during the practical exam and served
their pancakes in a creative manner.</p>

<h3>Food Sustainability</h3>
<p>As part of the Food Literacy lesson, students learnt to be a sustainable
consumer by making purchasing decisions that are friendly for the environment.
In both Upper and Lower Secondary practical lessons, students have a chance
to harvest food produced directly from the Kranji’s Edible Garden and use
it as part of the main ingredients in cooking and for garnishing.</p>

<h3>Maker Programme&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Maker Programme was conducted for our Secondary 1 to 5 students at
the beginning of the year in Term 1. The objective of the activity is for
our students to appreciate Singapore food cultures through recipe modification.
Different ethnic ingredients such as blue pea flower, pandan paste, coconut
milk and rose syrup were infused into a simple agar recipe. Utilizing a
variety of natural colourings, students prepared multi-coloured agar cubes
and assembled them to create their own Mirror Magic Agar.</p>

<h3>NFS baking and culinary competition</h3>
<p>Every year, students are given the opportunity to participate in various
cooking and baking competitions. The competition provides a platform for
students to apply their nutritional knowledge through developing suitable
recipes to meet the nutritional needs of the different age groups. Students
will then have the opportunity to demonstrate their culinary skills and
oral presentation when displaying the final products before a judging panel.
These enriching experiences enable students to apply what they have learnt
in FCE/ F&amp;N lessons and encourage them to see the relevance of the
subject in their daily lives.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>The Music unit aims to develop students’ abilities for creative expression
through various modes of music making. Students’ awareness and appreciation
of music of different cultures will also be cultivated during the 2-year
Lower Secondary Music programme.</p>
<p><strong>Music – Teaching and Learning Syllabus</strong>
</p>
<p>Sec 1 students will go through instrumental modules where they will attain
basic skills of playing the keyboard and ukulele. Through the modules,
elements of Music are also introduced to ensure a holistic learning for
students. Students’ musical competencies will be expanded through the use
of ensemble playing and opportunities are provided for students to showcase
their learning and final performances.</p>
<p>For Sec 2 students, besides advanced instrumental modules, they will also
deepen the musical concepts learnt thus far, by going through the Song
Arrangement module where they experience and gain knowledge on the basics
of song arrangement such as music genres, instrumentation and music technology.</p>
<p>Additionally, they also go through a module of Jam Band where they will
work closely in small groups to perform their chosen song to a live audience.
Opportunities are also provided for students to record their performances
as part of their portfolio.</p>
