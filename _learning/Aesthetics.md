<h1>The Aesthetics Department</h1>
<p>The Aesthetics Department encompasses four dynamic subjects: <strong>Art, Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T), and Nutrition &amp; Food Science (NFS) and Music</strong>.
Within these subjects, students embark on a journey of self-expression,
exploration, and practical application. From the visual realms of painting
and sculpture to the harmonious melodies of music, and the functional elegance
of design, to the science behind nutrition and food, our department offers
a diverse array of avenues for both artistic and scientific expression.
Students learn various skills such as prototyping, culinary &amp; food
science experimental skills, music and art making. They also learn project
management skills, creativity and empathy, through learning journeys, workshops,
community projects and competitions.</p>

<p>In addition to the four academic subjects, the department runs two key
programs—'Arts-experiences' and 'Kranji Got Talent'—to inspire students
to appreciate the beauty of the world and contribute through their unique
talents and perspectives.</p>
<h4>Artsperiences</h4>
<p>In 2024, the department launched a pilot initiative offering a variety
of workshops to cater to students' diverse interests. These aesthetic workshops
cover a range of activities, including sand art, ceramics making, drumming,
and more. Students can sign up for any workshop that appeals to their interests.</p>

<h4>Kranji Got Talent (KGT)</h4>
<p>Kranji Got Talent is an annual event that celebrates the diverse artistic
talents of our students. Each year, auditions bring excitement to the school
as students showcase their skills in areas like singing, dancing, DJing,
and more. The event provides a platform for aspiring performers while allowing
the school community to experience the vibrant and dynamic culture. Finalists
from the auditions have the opportunity to perform at major school events,
where they are met with enthusiastic support from both students and teachers.</p>

<p>The Art unit aims to develop Kranjians’ passion for art; thinkers who
are capable of communicating visually through various means of Art making.
Through these efforts of perceiving, communicating and appreciating Art,
students develop the confidence to discuss, respond and connect their lived
experiences with society and culture.</p>
<h3>Teaching and Learning Syllabus</h3>
<hr>
<p>To achieve a learner-centred curriculum, the Lower and Upper Secondary
Art are aligned to the three big ideas in the revised Lower Secondary Art
syllabus which are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Art helps us to see in new ways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Art tells stories about our world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Art influences how we live</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas serve to meaningfully contextualise the components of Art
learning. The inquiry-based learning approach considers the designing of
the curriculum with themes carefully chosen to make Art relevant to Kranjians’
daily lives. The Arts Education Programme in Kranji aims to be inclusive
and differentiated to cater to all students.</p>
<p>To extend the learning of sculptures, the Secondary 1 students will be
given an inquiry based task to create sculptures using recycled materials.
The Art unit aims to widen the exposure of different art forms for students
to express their thoughts, experiences and feelings in different ways.</p>

<p>Our entire level of Secondary 2 students participated in the Live On Festival
(LOF) 2022 – Design Competition. Out of the 2200 entries received from
83 schools, our student Lim Hui Ler, Esther from 2K2,&nbsp; emerged as
one of the winners.</p>

<p>Theme: Everyday ThingsTitle: Hope has come</p>
<p>&gt; “My artwork depicts two kidneys- one healthy and the other dying.
The healthy kidney is portrayed as a functioning and growing metropolis.
The people in the city are strong, healthy and carefree, and going about
their normal lives with friends and family. However, the dying kidney is
portrayed as a war-torn city, reduced to a pile of rubble.To me, war is
a terrible situation and it happens in many countries. Like a disease,
it destroys and robs people of hope, love, and joy. The enemy soldier,
pointing a gun at one of the civilians represents the threat and effect
of diseases which is the reason why the kidney failed. The two civilians
represent the last shred of hope and life left before the entire kidney
shuts down. However, hope is not lost as help is sent from the thriving
metropolis to the war-torn city to aid their woes and rebuild the city.
The soldier and the paramedic on the bridge represent organ donation, which
gives hope to the people in need of a new organ. I hope that through my
artwork, I could bring forth this message: Do your part to give hope. Donate
your organs now.”</p>
<p>Esther 2K2</p>
<p>Secondary 3 students experimented with a variety of materials, techniques
and technologies to translate their ideas into visual forms and expressions.</p>
<h3>Learning beyond school</h3>
<p>To enable students to connect and respond to artworks, students will experience
museum-based learning as part of their learning journey. This is to cultivate
visual literacy skills and appreciation of the Art world.</p>

<p>The National Gallery Singapore takes art education on the road with its
new Roving Art Truck launched in June 2022. This unique art programme aims
to encourage our students to head down to explore our National Gallery
Singapore. The truck houses 10 iconic paintings from the National Collection
in Singapore. It was in Kranji Secondary School from 22 to 24 August 2022
for students to encounter Art outside the museum. The truck provided an
unusual experience for the students to co-create and engage in various
activities.</p>
<p>&gt; “When I first saw the art truck, I was amazed by the truck’s interesting
design as it was colourful, vibrant and had an attractive camouflaging
pattern. When I went in the truck it almost felt like it was a museum due
to the environment there! I had a chance to look at the 10 different artworks
made by different artists in Southeast Asia but there are three pieces
that will be further researched on. The three pieces are <a href="https://m.facebook.com/nationalgallerysg/photos/born-in-vietnam-le-pho-moved-to-paris-in-1937-and-stayed-on-in-the-city-until-hi/1355313587817694/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Harmony in Green: The Two sisters by Lê Phõ</a> made
in 1938 drawn on silk. The second piece is <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/ahmad-sadali-skyline-of-new-york/MQJC52NKtpn7LQ?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Skyline of New York by Ahmad Sadali</a> in
1957. What I found compelling is that the artist could express the skyline
buildings just by using different lines and shapes to achieve a sense of
unity. Finally, the painting the <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.sg/see-do/programme-detail/430762430/chua-mia-tee-directing-the-real" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Portable Cinema by Chua Mia Tee</a> created
in 1963 is the most interesting and hence will be doing further research
on it. The way the artist used the different colours made it really vibrant
and realistic! &gt; &gt; I also decided to do this drawing as I am interested
to discover how Singapore was like in the olden days. Overall, it was a
brilliant and immersive experience as if the museum came to school! I definitely
had fun and learnt more about the elements of art and the design principles!
I hope there’ll be more interesting events like this in the future!”</p>

<h2>Design and Technology</h2>
<p>For the Design and Technology (D&amp;T) unit, our aim is to develop a
cohesive team of D&amp;T staff and bring out the best in all learners by
igniting their passion for learning.</p>
<p>To build up the interest of our Lower Secondary students in D&amp;T, they
will learn about research work on existing products, pencil holder and
hand phone holder. They will also learn and work on sketching, ideation
(Shape Borrowing and SCAMPER) and developing their own designs. To realise
their designs, the students will make mock-ups using cardboards/perforated
boards. Finally, the students will make their own prototypes with acrylic
or wood using the various machines and hand tools in the D&amp;T workshop.</p>
<p>In 2022, we received our 1st batch of FSBB Secondary 1 students, with
a mixture of G1, G2 and G3 in the same class. We approach the students’
learning in D&amp;T common curriculum using Differentiated Instructions
(DI), based on their readiness and pace of learning. The students work
well with one another as they shared their knowledge and learning in D&amp;T.</p>
<p>We also embark on using digital sketching app such as Paint 3D and Canvas
for our Lower Secondary to work on their assignment. This allows our students
to ideate and develop using digital sketching app, besides the traditional
pencil and paper.</p>

<p>For the Upper Secondary, our school offers to the students D&amp;T elective
which is a coursework and theory based (structures, mechanisms and electronics)
subject to prepare them for the GCE N and ‘O’ level National Examination.</p>
<p>With the new normal, our graduating cohort were able to work on their
D&amp;T coursework physically in school with 100% submission in 2022.</p>

<h3>Maker Programme</h3>
<p>For this year, the D&amp;T unit continues to have its in-house Maker Programme
to allow students tinkering their area of interest through hands-on activity
outside classroom learning. There is a Makerspace where students have an
opportunity to explore their own interests, learn to use hand tools and
machines and work with materials to develop creative projects.</p>
<p>The students gotten to design and make a coin box out of wood. In the
process, the students were guided by D&amp;T teachers and Technical Support
Officers (TSO) and the activity took place in term 2.</p>
<p>Students work collaboratively to design and make the prototype and through
this activity, these students discussed, make decision and solve any challenges
arose in the process. Not only they built confidence in the process, the
students really enjoyed themselves and took pride in their work upon completion.
Do keep a look out for the next Maker activities.</p>

<h3>Student Initiated-Learning, SLS (3D Printer)</h3>
<p>For this year, as part of Student-Initiated Learning (SIL), the D&amp;T
unit embarked on the designing and fabricating using the 3D printer. The
students were taught 3D digital app using the Paint 3D, converting the
final digitalised idea into the 3D printer for making. It was an exciting
journey for students who used the 3D for the first time in school.</p>

<h2>Nutrition and Food Science</h2>
<p>The Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) unit aims to educate students with
knowledge in Nutrition &amp; Health, Food Literacy, Consumer Literacy and
Food Science. We aim to provide our graduating students with a foundation
that can be useful if they would like to pursue food sciences or other
food related courses during their tertiary education.</p>
<h3>Food Photography</h3>
<p>In 2022, we received our 1st batch of FSBB Secondary 1 students, with
a mixture of G1, G2 and G3 in the same class. We approach the students’
learning in FCE common curriculum using Differentiated Instructions (DI),
based on their readiness and pace of learning. The students worked on a
coursework project which required them to plan and prepare an attractive
and nutritious pancake dish for teenagers in school. Students applied their
knowledge of plating and garnishing during the practical exam and served
their pancakes in a creative manner.</p>

<h3>Food Sustainability</h3>
<p>As part of the Food Literacy lesson, students learnt to be a sustainable
consumer by making purchasing decisions that are friendly for the environment.
In both Upper and Lower Secondary practical lessons, students have a chance
to harvest food produced directly from the Kranji’s Edible Garden and use
it as part of the main ingredients in cooking and for garnishing.</p>

<h3>Maker Programme&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Maker Programme was conducted for our Secondary 1 to 5 students at
the beginning of the year in Term 1. The objective of the activity is for
our students to appreciate Singapore food cultures through recipe modification.
Different ethnic ingredients such as blue pea flower, pandan paste, coconut
milk and rose syrup were infused into a simple agar recipe. Utilizing a
variety of natural colourings, students prepared multi-coloured agar cubes
and assembled them to create their own Mirror Magic Agar.</p>

<h3>NFS baking and culinary competition</h3>
<p>Every year, students are given the opportunity to participate in various
cooking and baking competitions. The competition provides a platform for
students to apply their nutritional knowledge through developing suitable
recipes to meet the nutritional needs of the different age groups. Students
will then have the opportunity to demonstrate their culinary skills and
oral presentation when displaying the final products before a judging panel.
These enriching experiences enable students to apply what they have learnt
in FCE/ F&amp;N lessons and encourage them to see the relevance of the
subject in their daily lives.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>The Music unit aims to develop students’ abilities for creative expression
through various modes of music making. Students’ awareness and appreciation
of music of different cultures will also be cultivated during the 2-year
Lower Secondary Music programme.</p>
<p><strong>Music – Teaching and Learning Syllabus</strong>
</p>
<p>Sec 1 students will go through instrumental modules where they will attain
basic skills of playing the keyboard and ukulele. Through the modules,
elements of Music are also introduced to ensure a holistic learning for
students. Students’ musical competencies will be expanded through the use
of ensemble playing and opportunities are provided for students to showcase
their learning and final performances.</p>
<p>For Sec 2 students, besides advanced instrumental modules, they will also
deepen the musical concepts learnt thus far, by going through the Song
Arrangement module where they experience and gain knowledge on the basics
of song arrangement such as music genres, instrumentation and music technology.</p>
<p>Additionally, they also go through a module of Jam Band where they will
work closely in small groups to perform their chosen song to a live audience.
Opportunities are also provided for students to record their performances
as part of their portfolio.</p>
