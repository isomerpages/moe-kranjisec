<h1>The Aesthetics Department</h1>
<p>The Aesthetics Department encompasses four dynamic subjects: <strong>Art, Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T), and Nutrition &amp; Food Science (NFS) and Music</strong>.
Within these subjects, students embark on a journey of self-expression,
exploration, and practical application. From the visual realms of painting
and sculpture to the harmonious melodies of music, and the functional elegance
of design, to the science behind nutrition and food, our department offers
a diverse array of avenues for both artistic and scientific expression.
Students learn various skills such as prototyping, culinary &amp; food
science experimental skills, music and art making. They also learn project
management skills, creativity and empathy, through learning journeys, workshops,
community projects and competitions.</p>

<p>In addition to the four academic subjects, the department runs two key
programs—'Arts-experiences' and 'Kranji Got Talent'—to inspire students
to appreciate the beauty of the world and contribute through their unique
talents and perspectives.</p>
<h4>Artsperiences</h4>
<p>In 2024, the department launched a pilot initiative offering a variety
of workshops to cater to students' diverse interests. These aesthetic workshops
cover a range of activities, including sand art, ceramics making, drumming,
and more. Students can sign up for any workshop that appeals to their interests.</p>

<h4>Kranji Got Talent (KGT)</h4>
<p>Kranji Got Talent is an annual event that celebrates the diverse artistic
talents of our students. Each year, auditions bring excitement to the school
as students showcase their skills in areas like singing, dancing, DJing,
and more. The event provides a platform for aspiring performers while allowing
the school community to experience the vibrant and dynamic culture. Finalists
from the auditions have the opportunity to perform at major school events,
where they are met with enthusiastic support from both students and teachers.</p>

<h3><strong><u>Art Unit</u></strong></h3>
<p>Our Art Programme promotes creativity, self-expression, critical thinking,
and problem-solving. It equips students with 21st-century skills through
traditional and contemporary mediums, including painting, drawing, photography,
digital, and mixed media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Kranji Secondary, learning extends beyond the classroom, with students
participating in art competitions to gain experience and recognition for
their talents. Learning journeys to museums expose them to local and international
art, fostering a deeper appreciation for the arts and cultural heritage.</p>
<p>As students progress through Upper Secondary, they develop their skills
and explore personal themes through advanced projects. They engage in deeper
conceptual thinking when they learn more about mediums in depth. In preparation
for future opportunities, students are encouraged to develop their own
style and prepare portfolios.</p>

<h3><strong><u>D&amp;T Unit</u></strong></h3>
<p>Design and Technology (D&amp;T) focuses on nurturing creativity, design
thinking, and problem-solving skills. Through hands-on learning and prototyping,
students explore real-world challenges, applying concepts from STEM education
to develop innovative solutions. This subject encourages critical thinking
and empowers students to bring their ideas to life.</p>
<p>The unit also incorporates projects that utilize recycled materials, such
as using recycled bottles for creating mock-ups. This approach aligns with
our commitment to sustainability and supports the principles of a circular
economy, as well as the Singapore Green Plan 2030.</p>
<p>To complement the curriculum, students are exposed to various workshops
that develop their 21st Century Competencies (21CC) and participate in
design competitions to expand their understanding beyond the D&amp;T subject.</p>

<h3><strong><u>NFS Unit</u></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;The <strong>Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) unit </strong>aims to
educate students with knowledge in Nutrition &amp; Health, Food Literacy,
Consumer Literacy and Food Science. We aim to provide our graduating students
with a foundation that can be useful if they would like to pursue food
sciences or other food related courses during their tertiary education.</p>
<p><strong>Our Curriculum<br></strong>In our lower secondary FCE FSBB classroom,
we welcomed a mix of Secondary 1 learners (G1, G2, G3) and adopted Differentiated
Instruction (DI) alongside EdTech to address their diverse readiness levels
and learning paces. Eg: We customized gamified lesson packages on SLS for
topics like food lab safety and hygiene, and used Pear Deck for interactive
lessons on nutrients and balanced diets.</p>
<p><strong>Food and Consumer Literacy<br></strong>Lower and upper secondary
students engaged in coursework projects focused on executing dishes that
meet the nutritional needs of various age groups, showcasing their plating
and garnishing skills. Aligned with the school’s Applied Learning Program
on sustainable living and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production),
students explored the circular economy by repurposing food waste into resources
like fertilizer. They harvested fresh produce from Kranji’s Edible Garden
for their dishes and, in collaboration with the Science Department, Secondary
3 NFS students sampled fish from the school's hydroponic garden to enhance
their understanding of sustainable food practices.</p>

<h4><strong>Baking and Culinary Competition</strong></h4>
<p>Each year, students participate in cooking and baking competitions that
allow them to apply their nutritional knowledge by creating innovative
recipes for different age groups. They demonstrate their culinary skills
and presentation abilities before a judging panel. These experiences help
students apply what they’ve learned in FCE/F&amp;N lessons and highlight
the subject's relevance in their daily lives.</p>

<h3><strong><u>Music Unit</u></strong></h3>
<p>The Music program aims to nurture students' creative expression through
a variety of music-making experiences while fostering an appreciation for
music from different cultures. Over the 2-year Lower Secondary Music curriculum,
students will develop both technical and musical skills.</p>
<p>In Sec 1, students will learn basic keyboard and ukulele skills through
instrumental modules, which also introduce core elements of music for a
well-rounded learning experience. Ensemble playing is a key feature, providing
opportunities for students to showcase their progress through performances.</p>
<p>The school will also be introducing a Performance Art-Based Learning program
for the entire Secondary One cohort. This initiative allows students to
experience live performances by professional artists at cultural venues,
helping to deepen their understanding of cultural and heritage identity.</p>
<p>In Sec 2, students will advance their instrumental abilities and deepen
their understanding of musical concepts. They will explore song arrangement,
learning about genres, instrumentation, and music technology. The program
also includes a Jam Band module, where students collaborate in small groups
to perform a chosen song for a live audience, with opportunities to record
their performances for their portfolio.</p>
