For the Design and Technology (D&T) unit, our aim is to develop a cohesive team of D&T staff and bring out the best in all learners by igniting their passion for learning.


To build up the interest of our lower secondary students in D&T, they will learn about research work on existing products, pencil holder and hand phone holder. They will also learn and work on sketching, ideation (Shape Borrowing and SCAMPER) and developing their own designs. To realise their designs, the students will make mock-ups using cardboards/perforated boards. Finally, the students will make their own artefacts with acrylic or wood using the various machines and hand tools in the D&T workshop.

For the upper secondary, our school offers to the students D&T elective which is a coursework and theory based (structures, mechanisms and electronics) subject to prepare them for the GCE N and ‘O’ level examination.  

Even during the COVID-19 situation, our students were still able to work on their ideation and practical hands-on in the school D&T workshops. With safe distancing in place, our D&T students learned to be socially responsible and took ownership of their own learning.  

Lower Sec students working on their ideas individually and in groups as part of Differentiated Instructions.
