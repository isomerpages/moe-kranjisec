The Science Department aims to inculcate in all students a genuine interest in Science and the ability to think critically in the subject. This is done through an innovative curriculum that incorporates various tools to scaffold thinking processes at both the Lower and Upper Secondary levels.  

For the Lower Secondary students, thinking routines as well as frameworks such as C-E-R (Claim, Evidence and Reasoning) are introduced to make their thinking more visible.  The Standards of Critical Thinking model is also weaved into the curriculum to serve as a guidepost to improve on the quality of students’ answers.

At Upper Secondary, lessons incorporate the inquiry approach to make learning more student-centric. Students are given opportunities to learn content through data and information given, as well as experiments to develop their information processing and problem solving skills. Students are also exposed to a greater variety of data-based questions to challenge their thinking processes and test on their application of knowledge gathered. This enables us to develop our students further as young scientists.

#### Programmes for our Budding Young Scientists:

Outside of the classroom, our department also provides opportunities to allow students to apply their learning. Various competition platforms and research experiences are also available for selected students who are ready to take on the subject at a higher level.

##### 1.    Nature Science Programme – Biodiversity Trail

s part of our school’s biodiversity education and outreach efforts, our Secondary 2 and 3 Green Ambassadors created biodiversity learning resources to educate our secondary 1 students about biodiversity in Kranji Marshes. The Green Ambassadors conceptualised a virtual learning trail which involves engagement in scientific inquiry through the use of Thinking Routines in the learning booklet and activities created on the Singapore Student Learning Space. Through these learning activities, our secondary 1 students gained deeper understanding about the interdependence of organisms in an ecosystem and its implication on conservation. This informal learning experience enables them to explore the core ideas of _Diversity_ in nature and _Pattern_ in biological classification of organisms. Participants also appreciate how the anatomical structures of organisms are related to their function through examples of birds.

Students and schools who are interested to access our resources in the Singapore Student Learning Space or participate in our virtual learning trail can email your request to [kranji\_ss@moe.edu.sg](mailto:kranji_ss@moe.edu.sg).
