### Humanities

### Humanities Department Vision

***To develop a community of passionate humanists, equipped with the knowledge and innovation for a rapidly changing world***

The Humanities Department believes in the transformative power of a humanities education to develop our students into analytical, critical and creative thinkers. We prepare our students for the challenges of the changing world by nurturing students into active global citizens, and lifelong learners and leaders.

**Notable Mention**

<img src="/images/hu4.png" style="width:120px;height:140px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> Tricia Loh Qiuxuan (Class of 2020, 4K4) is awarded the MOE Humanities Scholarship to pursue the Humanities Programme at Eunioa Junior College. The Humanities Programme is an interdisciplinary programme that aims to develop the humanities scholars into values-driven and thought leaders at the local, regional and global levels. Recipients of this scholarship will be exposed to exciting opportunities such as overseas enrichment programme and attending local and overseas conferences.

#### Key Humanities Programmes

##### Incorporation of 21st century competencies in Humanities subjects

To prepare Kranjians for the future, 21st century competencies are integrated into the teaching of Geography, History and Social Studies. The teaching and assessment of these three subjects aim to develop Kranjians’ cognitive competencies in critical thinking, analysis and problem solving, as well as interpersonal and intrapersonal competencies in ethical values, social and organisational skills.

##### Focus on ASEAN in Humanities Curriculum

Southeast Asia, one of the fastest growing regions in the world, together with China, India, Japan and Korea, collectively form Singapore’s natural hinterland. The Humanities curriculum provides students with a deeper appreciation of the geographies, histories, cultures, languages, and economies of countries in our region.

  

To position our students to understand ASEAN better and seize new opportunities from ASEAN’s growth, our department aims to equip students with the knowledge, language and cultural skills to succeed in our region. One such platform is the “ASEAN Youths in Climate Action” discussion series that our department has co-organised with the ASEAN Studies Centre, a research think tank with the Institute of South East Asian Studies (ISEAS) in Singapore.

##### Geographical Investigation & Historical Inquiry

Geographical Investigation and Historical Inquiry provide platforms for Kranjians to conduct authentic historical and geographical research beyond the classroom. Through such inquiry-based approach, all Geography and History students exercise and develop self and relationship management skills, which are important for life.

In continuing to provide our students with the rich learning experience from Geographical Investigation and Historical Inquiry in spite of curbs on on-site fieldwork due to the pandemic, our department brings the investigation into the classroom. For instance, we have created a virtual field trip using Google Earth with resources such as 360° scenes and 3-dimensional artefacts to replicate life and living in Singapore’s kampongs in the 1960s and 1970s. Students will be able to access the virtual field trip using their mobile phones and engage in an immersive learning experience anytime, anywhere and at their own pace.
