##### 1. English Reading Programme  

Reading extensively is an integral part of language learning. The objectives of the school’s English Reading Programme are:  

 *   To develop good reading habits in students
 *   To help students sharpen their language skills and broaden their general knowledge
 *   To enable students to widen their range of vocabulary
 *   To enhance students’ ability to generate and develop ideas for expository writing and spoken interaction


The department subscribes to a range of magazine titles for students. The titles are selected based on their suitability for each level/stream, considering the profiles and language competencies of students. Reading time is set aside in the morning for students to do silent reading together as a school. Apart from the assigned magazines, students are also encouraged to read their own reading material on selected days during the morning reading time.

Each month, a one-hour English lesson is used for the discussion of a selected magazine article. Thinking Routines are adopted as a key pedagogy to facilitate class discussion of topics/issues featured in the magazine article. Thereafter, students write an individual reading reflection piece on the magazine article, based on guiding questions aligned to the Thinking Routine(s) employed during the class discussion.
