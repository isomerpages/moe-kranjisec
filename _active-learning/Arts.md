### Arts

The Art unit aims to develop Kranjians’ passion for art; thinkers who are capable to communicate visually through various means of Art making. Through these efforts of perceiving, communicating and appreciating Art, students develop the confidence to discuss, respond and connect their lived experiences with society and culture.

#### Teaching and Learning Syllabus

To achieve a learner-centred curriculum, the Lower and Upper Secondary Art are aligned to the three big ideas in the revised Lower Secondary Art syllabus which are:

 *   Art helps us to see in new ways
 *   Art tells stories about our world
 *   Art influences how we live

These ideas serve to meaningfully contextualise the components of Art learning. The inquiry-based learning approach considers the designing of the curriculum with themes carefully chosen to make Art relevant to Kranjians’ daily lives. Thus, Kranjians explored and inquired themes on the environment, _SG Bicentennial, Art Represent The Unsung Heroes_ to honour the essential and front-line workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, etc. The Arts Education Programme in Kranji aims to be inclusive and differentiated to cater to all students.
