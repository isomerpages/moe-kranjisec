### Physical Education

#### Team Physical Education (PE)

##### PE Curriculum

Team PE engage our students’ learning of Physical Sports through series of Games Modules over a range of sports under the categories of striking-fielding, net barrier, target and invasion.

  

Lessons deliveries focus not just the development of psychomotor, but includes thinking skills, character development, values inculcation and student’s displaying positive personal and social behaviour across experiences.

  

The motor skills and teamwork which underline the Physical domain that the students have learnt and demonstrated during PE lessons are measures in term of their performance displayed throughout the course of game module they are in, in addition to the Cognitive (game knowledge and concept) domain that are to be assessed. Likewise, in the Affective domain, students are assessed based on their behavioural displayed during PE lessons.

  

##### Road Run, Sports Day, Inter-House Games and others

Kranjians get to participate in the Annual Inter-House Road Run activities during the Sports Fiesta which is held at running locations around the school and Choa Chu Kang estate.

  

During the Annual Sports Day, students get to compete among themselves representing their respective Houses over running events.  

  

Inter-House Games (IHG) serve as opportunities for all students to enjoy sports and engage in an active lifestyle. On the day itself, students will represent their house in sports such as football, captain ball, badminton, floorball, basketball, frisbee, touch rugby, volleyball and softball. Various fun game booths are also set up by the different houses to test skills and abilities of everyone!  

  

At the end of the day, points will be calculated from every victory and a house champion will be named for the year.

The Secondary 3 MOE-OBS Multi-School Cohort Camp seeks to develop ruggedness, resilience, and build cohesion amongst our students through outdoor experience. It also helps our students to build friendships with students from different school backgrounds and actively help each other to achieve team goals in an inclusive manner.
