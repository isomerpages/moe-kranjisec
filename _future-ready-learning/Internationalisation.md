Internationalisation is an important thrust under MOE’s Learn for Life Agenda. The Internationalisation Programme is our school’s vehicle to provide our students with different opportunities to understand the histories, cultures, and economies of countries around the world, particularly those in Asia, and these countries’ interconnections with Singapore.

Our students participate in virtual school exchanges with schools in China, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand, spanning between six months and one year. Virtual exchanges have enabled our students to collaborate with peers from partner schools on projects relating to sustainability and STEM. Through synchronous and asynchronous interactions with peers from around the world, our students learn more about their cultures and collaborate on meaningful projects that enhance their global awareness and cross-cultural skills.

This year, our school resumed our physical overseas internationalisation trips as these trips provide students with important experiential touchpoints to gain exposure to the world around them, and to network and build strong ties with their overseas peers. In July, a group of 30 students and 5 staff visited Triam Udom Suksa Pattanakarn Suvarnabhumi School in Bangkok, Thailand. In October, another group of 26 students and 4 staff visited Tucheng Senior High School in Tainan, Taiwan. During these school exchanges, our students joined their foreign peers to showcase their projects, which were the fruits of their joint collaboration over the year. Students also participated in various cultural activities to deepen their understanding of local culture and socio-economic ties to Singapore.


### Study Visit to Tokyo, Japan

In 2021, we were named as the First Prize winner of the Education for Sustainable Development Award, presented by the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan for our school distinctive programmes in “Securing Educational Opportunities in COVID-19 Crisis”. As the First Prize winner, our four student ambassadors embarked on a study trip to Tokyo, Japan in September 2023, which is an excellent opportunity for them to network with peers in Japan and have a deeper understanding of cross-cultural literacy and global awareness.

### Internationalisation Fair

The inaugural Internationalisation Fair was held in October 2023. The fair was put up by teachers and students participating in the various school exchange programmes with our partner schools in China, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand. This fair provided students who had previously participated in exchange programmes with the opportunity to synthesise and share their rich learning gleaned from these exchange programmes with their peers. Teachers also conducted sharing to broaden students’ exposure to different countries from around the world. Through the fair, students gained a deeper understanding of countries around the world and the intricate relationships that Singapore has with these countries.
