Internationalisation is an important thrust under MOE’s Learn for Life Agenda. The Internationalisation Programme is our school’s vehicle to provide our students with different opportunities to understand the histories, cultures, and economies of countries around the world, particularly those in Asia, and these countries’ interconnections with Singapore. Despite travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual platforms have provided us with the means to create global classrooms and replicate internationalisation experiences without stepping beyond our shores.

### Upcoming Internationalisation Events

In recent years, students from Kranji Secondary School and our international partner schools have developed global awareness and cross-cultural skills through the opportunity to interact with one another during virtual exchange programmes. 

The **Global Classroom – Asia Networking Session**, a biennial conference seeks to provide a virtual platform for students from our international partner schools to network and dialogue on the complexities and intricacies of emerging and current global affairs. By listening to and discussing opinions with students from other countries, delegates will learn more about their similarities and differences, developing a shared sense of solidarity with their global peers. The conference also provides delegates with the opportunity to hone their public speaking and critical thinking skills, as they consider issues from different perspectives.

The biannual **ASEAN Symposium for Youth** is a platform for secondary school students in Singapore to discuss key issues concerning ASEAN with policy makers, academics, and youth leaders in the region. It provides opportunities for participants to research and gain insights into the complexities and intricacies of pertinent issues and challenges affecting the region in the societal, economic, cultural, environmental and political domains beyond the secondary school curriculum; as well as to explore new perspectives on ASEAN regionalism.

The first edition of the Symposium in 2022 saw some 710 students from 70 secondary schools in Singapore participating, including students from our partner school in Thailand and the Philippines. Watch this space for the **2nd ASEAN Symposium for Secondary School Students** in 2024.

### The Education for Sustainable Development Award – First Prize winner

The Education for Sustainable Development Award recognises education and learning that promotes sustainable development. In 2021, the theme was “Securing Educational Opportunities in COVID-19 Crisis” and we were one of the 282 schools from eight Southeast Asian countries which submitted entries for this award. Due to our strong internationalisation efforts, we were named the First Prize winner of the Education for Sustainable Development Award, which was presented by the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.

The Ministry of Education has featured our e-internationalisation programmes on schoolbag, a news website that provides parents, educators and the general public with education news, school features and tips. The article “The World is my Classroom” narrates our school’s approach in continuing to provide our students with an international experience despite the COVID-19 situation and the rich learning that student participants had obtained from this programme.

### ASEAN Symposium

One of our key internationalisation programmes is the ASEAN Symposium, which is conducted in partnership with the Institute of South East Asian Studies–ASEAN Studies Centre. It provides our students with a dialogue platform to discuss ASEAN-related issues with policymakers and academic representatives, and learn more about the opportunities and challenges facing ASEAN through case studies and research projects.

The 2022 Symposium theme was “The Future of ASEAN”. It aimed to engage today’s youth on the longstanding and current issues and challenges that ASEAN faces, and to propose solutions to overcome them. While ASEAN member states have made significant progress in attaining their United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), more needs to be done in areas such as environmental sustainability.  The symposium therefore challenged students to work together to propose solutions for the future they envision for ASEAN. Over 700 students from 70 Secondary Schools attended the two-day virtual symposium. Students from our partner schools in the Philippines and Thailand also participated and shared rich and diverse perspectives on their countries’ efforts to achieve the UNSDGs.

In addition, virtual school exchanges with overseas school partners have allowed us to scale up our internationalisation efforts as more students are now able to benefit from an extended internationalisation experience. Recurring virtual school exchanges have also allowed us to overcome the constraint posed by physical school exchanges, wherein the interactions with our partner schools are limited to a visit of less than a week. Through synchronous and asynchronous interactions with peers from around the world, our students learn more about their cultures and collaborate on meaningful projects that enhance their global awareness and cross-cultural skills.
