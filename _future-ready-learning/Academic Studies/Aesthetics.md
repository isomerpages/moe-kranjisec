The Art unit aims to develop Kranjians’ passion for art; thinkers who are capable of communicating visually through various means of Art making. Through these efforts of perceiving, communicating and appreciating Art, students develop the confidence to discuss, respond and connect their lived experiences with society and culture.

### Teaching and Learning Syllabus
------------------------------

To achieve a learner-centred curriculum, the Lower and Upper Secondary Art are aligned to the three big ideas in the revised Lower Secondary Art syllabus which are:

*   Art helps us to see in new ways 
*   Art tells stories about our world
*   Art influences how we live
    

These ideas serve to meaningfully contextualise the components of Art learning. The inquiry-based learning approach considers the designing of the curriculum with themes carefully chosen to make Art relevant to Kranjians’ daily lives. The Arts Education Programme in Kranji aims to be inclusive and differentiated to cater to all students.

To extend the learning of sculptures, the Secondary 1 students will be given an inquiry based task to create sculptures using recycled materials. The Art unit aims to widen the exposure of different art forms for students to express their thoughts, experiences and feelings in different ways.

Our entire level of Secondary 2 students participated in the Live On Festival (LOF) 2022 – Design Competition. Out of the 2200 entries received from 83 schools, our student Lim Hui Ler, Esther from 2K2,  emerged as one of the winners.

<center>Title: Hope has come</center>

> “My artwork depicts two kidneys- one healthy and the other dying. The healthy kidney is portrayed as a functioning and growing metropolis. The people in the city are strong, healthy and carefree, and going about their normal lives with friends and family. However, the dying kidney is portrayed as a war-torn city, reduced to a pile of rubble.To me, war is a terrible situation and it happens in many countries. Like a disease, it destroys and robs people of hope, love, and joy. The enemy soldier, pointing a gun at one of the civilians represents the threat and effect of diseases which is the reason why the kidney failed. The two civilians represent the last shred of hope and life left before the entire kidney shuts down. However, hope is not lost as help is sent from the thriving metropolis to the war-torn city to aid their woes and rebuild the city. The soldier and the paramedic on the bridge represent organ donation, which gives hope to the people in need of a new organ. I hope that through my artwork, I could bring forth this message: Do your part to give hope. Donate your organs now.”

Esther 2K2

Secondary 3 students experimented with a variety of materials, techniques and technologies to translate their ideas into visual forms and expressions.

### Learning beyond school

To enable students to connect and respond to artworks, students will experience museum-based learning as part of their learning journey. This is to cultivate visual literacy skills and appreciation of the Art world.

The National Gallery Singapore takes art education on the road with its new Roving Art Truck launched in June 2022. This unique art programme aims to encourage our students to head down to explore our National Gallery Singapore. The truck houses 10 iconic paintings from the National Collection in Singapore. It was in Kranji Secondary School from 22 to 24 August 2022 for students to encounter Art outside the museum. The truck provided an unusual experience for the students to co-create and engage in various activities.

> “When I first saw the art truck, I was amazed by the truck’s interesting design as it was colourful, vibrant and had an attractive camouflaging pattern. When I went in the truck it almost felt like it was a museum due to the environment there! I had a chance to look at the 10 different artworks made by different artists in Southeast Asia but there are three pieces that will be further researched on. The three pieces are [Harmony in Green: The Two sisters by Lê Phõ](https://m.facebook.com/nationalgallerysg/photos/born-in-vietnam-le-pho-moved-to-paris-in-1937-and-stayed-on-in-the-city-until-hi/1355313587817694/) made in 1938 drawn on silk. The second piece is [Skyline of New York by Ahmad Sadali](https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/ahmad-sadali-skyline-of-new-york/MQJC52NKtpn7LQ?hl=en) in 1957. What I found compelling is that the artist could express the skyline buildings just by using different lines and shapes to achieve a sense of unity. Finally, the painting the [Portable Cinema by Chua Mia Tee](https://www.nationalgallery.sg/see-do/programme-detail/430762430/chua-mia-tee-directing-the-real) created in 1963 is the most interesting and hence will be doing further research on it. The way the artist used the different colours made it really vibrant and realistic!
> 
> I also decided to do this drawing as I am interested to discover how Singapore was like in the olden days. Overall, it was a brilliant and immersive experience as if the museum came to school! I definitely had fun and learnt more about the elements of art and the design principles! I hope there’ll be more interesting events like this in the future!”

## Music

The Music unit aims to develop students’ abilities for creative expression through various modes of music making. Students’ awareness and appreciation of music of different cultures will also be cultivated during the 2-year Lower Secondary Music programme.

**Music – Teaching and Learning Syllabus**

Sec 1 students will go through instrumental modules where they will attain basic skills of playing the keyboard and ukulele. Through the modules, elements of Music are also introduced to ensure a holistic learning for students. Students’ musical competencies will be expanded through the use of ensemble playing and opportunities are provided for students to showcase their learning and final performances.

For Sec 2 students, besides advanced instrumental modules, they will also deepen the musical concepts learnt thus far, by going through the Song Arrangement module where they experience and gain knowledge on the basics of song arrangement such as music genres, instrumentation and music technology. 

Additionally, they also go through a module of Jam Band where they will work closely in small groups to perform their chosen song to a live audience. Opportunities are also provided for students to record their performances as part of their portfolio.
