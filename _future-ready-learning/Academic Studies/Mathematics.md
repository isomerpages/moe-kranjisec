## Objective

To develop a dynamic team of teachers and students with a passion for mathematics.

### Key Programmes

The Mathematics department engages students in the learning of mathematics using real-world applications of mathematics in lessons. We enrich students’ learning experiences by providing various enrichment activities such as Mathematics Trail and **STEM** (**S**cience, **T**echnology, **E**ngineering, **M**athematics) Week. In addition, we provide opportunities for students to hone their mathematical problem-solving skills in various competitions such as the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad and Australian Mathematics Competition.

Through **STEM** infused lessons, students develop the **3C**s (Be **C**urious, Be **C**reative, Be the **C**hange)

Incorporation of real-world learning experiences into lessons enables students to acquire and understand mathematics while seeing the relevance of the subject in the world around them.

<center>Code for Fun Programme</center>

The Code for Fun Programme is a joint initiative by IMDA and MOE to increase students’ exposure to coding and computational thinking. The programme provides opportunities for students to be engaged in learning mathematical skills such as Spatial Visualization, Data Handling and Analysis, Geometry and Measurement. Students will use microcontrollers, basic drag and drop coding and cardboard Lego Blocks known as Blokies to build different physical structures based on their understanding of STEM to solve real world problems.

<center>Math Trail</center>

The Secondary One students participated in a Mathematics Trail during the Sec 1 orientation. The various stations organised by the teachers provided opportunities for students to improve their mathematical thinking outside the classroom. Students also developed their creativity and collaborative skills as they work in teams to solve real world problems.

Students are given the opportunity to participate in various competitions held locally and internationally to expose them to the rigours of competitive mathematics.
