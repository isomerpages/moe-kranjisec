## Objective

To develop a dynamic team of teachers and students with a passion for mathematics.

### Key Programmes

The Mathematics department engages students in the learning of mathematics using real-world applications of mathematics in lessons. We enrich students’ learning experiences by providing various enrichment activities such as Mathematics Trail and **STEM** (**S**cience, **T**echnology, **E**ngineering, **M**athematics) Week. In addition, we provide opportunities for students to hone their mathematical problem-solving skills in various competitions such as the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad and Australian Mathematics Competition.

<center>ICT - Infused Learning</center>
The Personal Learning Devices allow students to learn at their own pace and to collaborate with each other online. Students also have the opportunities to investigate mathematical problems with their friends and work out the solutions together.

Incorporation of real-world learning experiences&nbsp;into lessons enables students to acquire and understand Mathematics while seeing the relevance of the subject in the world around them. Through STEM-infused lessons, students develop the 3Cs (Be Curious, Be Creative, Be the Change).

</p><center>Code For Fun</center>
The Code for Fun Programme is a joint initiative by IMDA and MOE to increase students’ exposure to coding and computational thinking. The programme provides opportunities for students to be engaged in learning mathematical skills such as Spatial Visualization, Data Handling and Analysis, Geometry and Measurement. Students will use microcontrollers, basic drag and drop coding and cardboard Lego Blocks known as Blokies to build different physical structures based on their understanding of STEM to solve real world problems.

</p><center>STEM Week</center>
During STEM week, students participated in level competitions to extend their knowledge in Mathematics and Science. The lower sec participated in the “Paper Helicopter” challenge to create their own paper helicopter. Meanwhile, the upper sec apply their math and science knowledge to build either a balloon-powered car or a solar-powered car.
