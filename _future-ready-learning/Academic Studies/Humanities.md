We prepare our students for the challenges of the changing world by nurturing students into active global citizens, and lifelong learners and leaders.

## Key Humanities Programmes

**Social Studies Issues Investigation, Geographical Investigation &amp; Historical Inquiry**

The Social Studies Issues Investigation project is a collaborative and inquiry-based group project that allows students to delve into allocated social issues and propose viable solutions. Through this project, students are encouraged to gather evidence and case studies from other countries to support their proposed solutions. In additional, the skills acquired during this project are applied in a real-world context when students plan their class-based VIA projects in the from August 2023. Students choose from a diverse range of social service agencies that focus on similar social causes and apply what they have learnt in the project to craft appropriate engagement opportunities with the agencies' beneficiaries.

Geographical Investigation and Historical Inquiry provide platforms for Kranjians to conduct authentic historical and geographical research beyond the classroom. Through such inquiry-based approach, all Geography and History students exercise and develop self and relationship management skills, which are important for life.

**Humanities-related Conferences and Competitions**

These conferences and competitions are excellent platforms for Kranjians to deepen their understanding of the complexities of international relations in our highly globalised world add value to our student learning of the humanities. For instance, participation in the Model United Nations Conferences organised by various Institutes of Higher Education has allowed our students to play the roles of country delegates and engage in simulated UN debates regarding global issues. They have the opportunity to hone their public speaking, reasoning, research and interpersonal skills, enabling them to come up with plausible and creative solutions to their assigned issue. The Historical Scene Investigation competition, organised by the National Library Board, allowed our students to research deeply into key historical events such as the Japanese Occupation and Singapore’s pre-Independence period.

The MOE History Challenge and NUS Geography Challenge engage humanities students in the disciplinary aspect of History and Geography. Students who performed well in the Challenge will be shortlisted to join the History Talent Development Programme (HTDP) or Geography Talent Development Programme (GTDP). The Talent Development Programme helps students to appreciate Singapore’s national identity and interests in relation to the region and the world. Students will get to engage in deep conversations and discussions about challenges and opportunities that Singapore faces as well as regional and international developments.
