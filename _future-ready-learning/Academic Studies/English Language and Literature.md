The following is a summary of our key programmes that you may want to read about:

## 1. English Reading Programme

Reading extensively is an integral part of language learning. The objectives of the school’s English Reading Programme are:

*   To develop good reading habits in students
*   To help students sharpen their language skills and broaden their general knowledge
*   To enable students to widen their range of vocabulary
*   To enhance students’ ability to generate and develop ideas for expository writing and spoken interaction

The department subscribes to a range of magazine titles for students. The titles are selected based on their suitability for each level/stream, considering the profiles and language competencies of students. Reading time is set aside in the morning for students to do silent reading together as a school. Apart from the assigned magazines, students are also encouraged to read their own reading material on selected days during the morning reading time.

Each month, a one-hour English lesson is used for the discussion of a selected magazine article. Thinking Routines are adopted as a key pedagogy to facilitate class discussion of topics/issues featured in the magazine article. Thereafter, students write an individual reading reflection piece on the magazine article, based on guiding questions aligned to the Thinking Routine(s) employed during the class discussion.

## 2. Speech and Drama Enrichment Programme

The Speech and Drama Enrichment Programme is offered to all Secondary 1 students and serves to achieve the following objectives:&nbsp;

*   To teach students the fundamentals of drama, such as basic acting and stage terminology, improvisation and movement, verbal and non-verbal elements of acting etc.
*   To enhance students’ competency in speech and articulation, enunciation and pronunciation
*   To inculcate in students 21st century competencies through working in teams&nbsp;

The programme is designed with the following student outcomes in mind:

*   Students are able to explain and apply their knowledge of basic speech and drama skills&nbsp;
*   Students are able to employ techniques culminating in a short assessment item done at the end of the programme
*   Students develop values of respect, resilience, teamwork and discipline during the enrichment programme

Here are a few photos showing our students in action during the Speech and Drama Enrichment Programme.
