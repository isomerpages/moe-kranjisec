##### 1. English Reading Programme  

Reading extensively is an integral part of language learning. The objectives of the school’s English Reading Programme are:  

 *   To develop good reading habits in students
 *   To help students sharpen their language skills and broaden their general knowledge
 *   To enable students to widen their range of vocabulary
 *   To enhance students’ ability to generate and develop ideas for expository writing and spoken interaction


The department subscribes to a range of magazine titles for students. The titles are selected based on their suitability for each level/stream, considering the profiles and language competencies of students. Reading time is set aside in the morning for students to do silent reading together as a school. Apart from the assigned magazines, students are also encouraged to read their own reading material on selected days during the morning reading time.

Each month, a one-hour English lesson is used for the discussion of a selected magazine article. Thinking Routines are adopted as a key pedagogy to facilitate class discussion of topics/issues featured in the magazine article. Thereafter, students write an individual reading reflection piece on the magazine article, based on guiding questions aligned to the Thinking Routine(s) employed during the class discussion.

The drama programme is offered to Secondary 1 students as part of the lower secondary Literature curriculum. It serves as an alternative platform for the expression of personal response through drama instead of the traditional pen-and-paper mode of assessment. In particular, the programme aims to achieve the following objectives:

*   To provide an authentic context for students to engage in deep learning through critical reading and analyses of the themes and characters in the Literature text
*   To provide opportunities for collaborative learning in the form of play-building so as to develop teamwork in students and improve their communication skills

The programme consists of a series of drama sessions conducted by qualified drama instructors and closely monitored by the school’s Literature teachers. Working in groups, students are actively involved in all the stages of play-building, from script writing, improvisation of props and costumes to the production of the play. The programme culminates in the final performance assessment of the play.


The drama programme is rigorous yet enjoyable for students. Its varied and engaging activities enrich students’ experiences in the learning of Literature.

##### 3. Literature Learning Journey

‘_Home: Our Neighbourhood_ ’ – A Literature Learning Journey (LJ) back to the Heartlands is designed to bring learning to life through a student-centric, multisensory learning experience. It involves students exploring their own neighbourhood – a place they call Home – where they discover historical facts and other interesting information relevant to a set of poems in the poetry curriculum. The LJ enables students to better appreciate local poetry and its ties with our uniquely Singaporean culture through authentic learning activities.


The poetry resource package is carefully curated to include poems that are relatable to, and tasks that can be carried out in any neighbourhood in Singapore. They explore issues that centre on the preservation of our cultural roots and heritage amidst the rapid modernisation of Singapore.
 

During the LJ, students are engaged in multimodal tasks that break away from the monotony of the usual pen-and-paper tasks. They explore their own neighbourhoods, visiting places like traditional coffee shops and children’s playgrounds etc. As they immerse in the multisensory experience offered by the surroundings, they take note of pertinent information, collect relevant artefacts and complete authentic tasks related to the poems in the poetry resource package.

With the implementation of Blended Learning (BL), students can embark on their own learning asynchronously, checking in with their teachers via timely online submissions using their Personal Learning Devices (PLD). As students organise their own learning and create products to reflect their personalised learning experiences, the LJ is a platform which supports independent learning and enhances students’ ownership of their own learning.

##### 4. Kranji Voices

Kranji Voices is a platform for Kranjians’ to share their personal experiences or views on any matter and have their voices heard by fellow Kranjians. It involves a 3-8 minute sharing, which could be in the form of storytelling, speech or oral presentation. This programme serves to raise awareness of personal experiences of Kranjians so as to highlight and reinforce the Kranjian Identity. The key objectives of Kranji Voices are: 

*   To reach out to students through the spoken language by highlighting common experiences and/or sharing of reflections, views and thoughts
*   To inspire students and/or to create a positive impact on students, thereby changing their mindset as well as behaviour positively
*   To develop students’ confidence in public speaking

Here is a video clip of a Kranjian giving a presentation to the school. Enjoy!

To develop students in their speaking skills, all Secondary 1 students embark on a Speaking Task as part of their weighted assessment for English Language. Please refer to the above video for more details regarding the programme.  

#### Students' Work

As part of Home-Based Learning Day, students were exposed to various types of poetry (Haiku, Acrostic, Free Verse) and challenged to create their own poems about their Kranji Experience. This alternative assessment task stretched students and gave them the opportunity to exercise creativity in poetry. The following are some samples of work created by our budding poets!
