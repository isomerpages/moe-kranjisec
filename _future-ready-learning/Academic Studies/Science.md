## Objectives 

Science@Kranji aims to develop students who are Inspired by Science, Inquire like Scientists and Innovate using Science. With a renewed focus on **S**cience, **T**echnology, **E**ngineering and **M**athematics (STEM), we envisage students who are passionate about STEM and equipped with the necessary competencies to solve complex real-world problems in future. 

Is it possible to build an effective water filtration device with a limited budget? Can you design a home gardening kit for edible vegetables to support Singapore’s food sustainability goals?



We believe that Science is more than the acquisition of knowledge; it is also a way of thinking and doing. Hence, we adopt the inquiry-based learning approach and focus on teaching the Practices of Science. The questions above are some examples of the problems that our students work on as part of the Science@Kranji curriculum.

### STEM Enrichment 

As enrichment, Secondary 1 students learnt how to make plastic from milk during their Orientation programme and Secondary 2 students participated in different STEM enrichment workshops during post-examination programme based on their interests to learn about cloud chambers, jam-making, aviation and flight science, forensic science etc. In addition, selected Secondary 4 students embarked on an industrial e-visit to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Singapore. All students also participated in STEM Week challenges. Through these experiences, students learnt about useful real-world applications of science to extend their knowledge from the classroom.

### KEPLER Programme (See KEPLER webpage for more details) 

* **Academic Competitions, Research Programmes, Fairs and Conferences**

Interested students are provided with opportunities to take part in Science Research and participate in numerous competitions and science fairs, such as the C.B. Paul Quiz, Singapore Junior Biology, Chemistry, Physics Olympiads, Illustratum Physics Competitions, National Crystal Growing Challenge, Elementz International Fair and the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair. Under the mentorship of teachers or scientist-mentors from the Science Centre and A\*STAR, students are guided to learn about scientific knowledge beyond the curriculum, apply their knowledge to solving problems, plan and carry out scientific investigations as well as showcase and communicate about Science.

* **Tucheng-Kranji e-Internationalisation**

A group of Secondary 3 students participated in the virtual exchange programme with Tu Cheng High School in Taiwan, working on cross-school collaborative projects to identify problems and ideate solutions relating to UN Sustainable Development Goals. This programme develops students’ awareness of global sustainability issues, promotes cross-cultural understanding and allows students to develop creative solutions using design thinking.

The Science Department aims to inculcate in all students a genuine interest in Science and the ability to think critically in the subject. This is done through an innovative curriculum that incorporates various tools to scaffold thinking processes at both the Lower and Upper Secondary levels.  

For the Lower Secondary students, thinking routines as well as frameworks such as C-E-R (Claim, Evidence and Reasoning) are introduced to make their thinking more visible.  The Standards of Critical Thinking model is also weaved into the curriculum to serve as a guidepost to improve on the quality of students’ answers.

At Upper Secondary, lessons incorporate the inquiry approach to make learning more student-centric. Students are given opportunities to learn content through data and information given, as well as experiments to develop their information processing and problem solving skills. Students are also exposed to a greater variety of data-based questions to challenge their thinking processes and test on their application of knowledge gathered. This enables us to develop our students further as young scientists.

#### Programmes for our Budding Young Scientists:

Outside of the classroom, our department also provides opportunities to allow students to apply their learning. Various competition platforms and research experiences are also available for selected students who are ready to take on the subject at a higher level.

##### 1.    Nature Science Programme – Biodiversity Trail

As part of our school’s biodiversity education and outreach efforts, our Secondary 2 and 3 Green Ambassadors created biodiversity learning resources to educate our secondary 1 students about biodiversity in Kranji Marshes. The Green Ambassadors conceptualised a virtual learning trail which involves engagement in scientific inquiry through the use of Thinking Routines in the learning booklet and activities created on the Singapore Student Learning Space. Through these learning activities, our secondary 1 students gained deeper understanding about the interdependence of organisms in an ecosystem and its implication on conservation. This informal learning experience enables them to explore the core ideas of _Diversity_ in nature and _Pattern_ in biological classification of organisms. Participants also appreciate how the anatomical structures of organisms are related to their function through examples of birds.

Students and schools who are interested to access our resources in the Singapore Student Learning Space or participate in our virtual learning trail can email your request to [kranji\_ss@moe.edu.sg](mailto:kranji_ss@moe.edu.sg).
