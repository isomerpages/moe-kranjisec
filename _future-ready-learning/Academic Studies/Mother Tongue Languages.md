####  Key Programmes

In line with Strategic Thrust 1 in Nurturing future-ready leaders with a heart to serve, the Mother Tongue Curriculum is customised to the different learning needs of all student segments. The programmes are categorised into the tiered programme - **Core**, **Enrichment** and **Aspire**.

In Tier 1, ‘**Core**’, the MTL department uses the News Reading Programme to incorporate global and national issues into classroom lessons. Students read MTL newspapers, magazines and articles (via SLS Newslink) during morning assemblies. MTL teachers will then follow up with newspapers/articles discussions at least once a week to expose students to current affairs and create global awareness.

The MTL department organised MTL Fortnight Programmes which are aimed at creating an immersive environment for the learning of Mother Tongue languages. These activities provide authentic opportunities for students to learn about their cultures and also to use their Mother Tongue languages. Students participated in hands-on activities and workshops such jewellery making, basic yoga, traditional games, Rangoli, Wau Batik painting, coaster weaving, Malay-Arabic (Jawi) basic calligraphy workshops, seal carving, fan painting, blow painting, lantern making, opera mask painting as well as martial arts. Through these activities, we hope to enrich our students’ learning experiences and develop them into individuals who love their culture and language.

The department also organised several events, such as Pongal Festival, Lunar New Year Celebrations, Hari Raya Celebrations and Deepavali Celebrations. These activities have enabled students to learn beyond classroom context and strengthen their sense of cultural heritage and identity.

In Tier 2, ‘**Enrichment**’, the MTL department developed an e-book that extensively encapsulates a detailed explanation of 6 different ethnic festivals, highlighting the significance of symbols and practices in order to address students’ misconceptions of festivals celebrated by the different ethnic groups in Singapore. For this innovation, our team aims to adopt Blended Learning using Student Learning Space (SLS) as a platform in order to optimise students’ learning. Sec 1 students accessed the e-book on their own and attempted the quizzes provided at the end to self-assess their understanding of the content provided in the e-book. They are also required to complete the SLS Oral package encompassing reading assessment, video submission, peer evaluation and post-survey as part of the alternative assessment. The following are some video presentations of our Sec 1 students in the role of a book promoter!

In Tier 3, '**Aspire**', Talent development is planned and carried out with the department taking varied approaches in providing opportunities to develop students to their fullest potential. For example, the department offers opportunities to students who show interest in stretching their potential in the subject by involving them in roles such as writing, editing, emceeing and performing for creative CL essay compilation - Kspiration publications and launch. We also provide selected students the exposure through numerous competition and workshop platforms to stretch students beyond meeting syllabus requirements.
