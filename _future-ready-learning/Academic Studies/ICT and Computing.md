*   Self-Directed Learners who take responsibility for their own learning, who question, reflect and persevere in the pursuit of learning, and are intrinsically motivated to monitor and manage their own learning using digital tools.
*   Collaborative Learners who are able to work with others and build on one another’s knowledge to achieve a common learning goal, adopt different viewpoints to explain their reasoning and decisions.
*   Responsible Citizens who contribute actively and value-add to the information pool in an online community, while observing proper etiquette and are able to verify the accuracy, credibility and currency of information across multiple sources.

### Technology In Action Sessions

In this day and age where information technology (ICT) has pervaded almost every area of our lives, teachers have to accept the reality that traditional methods of teaching are not as effective in engaging this generation of ICT-savvy students. Increasingly, the teacher’s role is to facilitate self-directed and collaborative learning, and technology has become a means to this end. To promote the use of ICT in school, Technology In Action sessions has been organised to promote the spirit of experimentation and innovation through effective and pervasive use of ICT in classroom teaching.

### ICT Blasts by ICT Champions

ICT Blasts are sent by ICT Champions fortnightly to promote the spirit of experimentation and innovation through effective and pervasive integration of ICT in classroom teaching. These serve as a supplementary resource for staff on technology related activities. They also serve as motivators to help encourage our teachers to incorporate the use of technology more meaningfully into their lessons.

### ICT Masterclass

ICT Masterclass is conducted by our ICT associate as part of customised PD on the use of technology in Teaching and Learning. These classes help teachers to stay current with emerging technologies. Recording of these sessions are made available for staff who are unable to attend on our PD google site.

### ICT Programme for Secondary 1

In line with the MOE National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) where the focus will be acquiring digital skills across four main components - Find, Think, Apply and Create, we planned for all Secondary One students in 2022 to undergo ‘Cardboard Sculpting, Upcycling and Design Thinking (using Tinkercad)’ training. The school is providing the following workshops in 2023 for students:

**Compulsory courses**
1. 3D modeling and Code for Fun - for all sec 1 students
2. Python programming - for all Sec 2 students

**Opt-in courses for Sec 1 & 2 students**
1. Video editing
2. App development
3. AR
4. Game development

### ICT Programme for Secondary 2

Kranji Secondary will be offering **O-Level Computing** from **2023 as an option in our Secondary 3 Subject Combination**. 

To cultivate students’ interest in computing, ‘Coding With Python’ workshop was offered in 2022 for all Secondary 2 Express and 2 Normal Academic students. The workshop was conducted online and includes the following:

* use of Python programming to design data analytics models; 
* hands-on and experiential project-based learning; and 
* application on mathematics computational thinking

From 2023, all secondary 2 students will have the opportunity to be exposed in Python programming as part of a deeper appreciation for ICT.

## O-Level Computing

Kranji Secondary will be offering O-Level Computing with effect from 2023 as an option in our Secondary 3 Subject Combination. 

The O-Level Computing subject is catered for students who display passion and/or talent in Computing. It focuses on developing problem-solving and Computational Thinking Skills in support of 21st Century Competencies as well as an appreciation of intellectual property and ethical issues arising from the use of technology.

The O-Level Computing subject is catered for students who display passion and/or talent in Computing. It focuses on developing problem-solving and Computational Thinking Skills in support of 21st Century Competencies as well as an appreciation of intellectual property and ethical issues arising from the use of technology. Students who offer the subject will also gain a head-start if they decide to take up computing-related studies or pursue computing-related careers in the future.

##### Objectives

The O Level Computing syllabus aims to provide students with the foundation to pursue further studies in computing at A-Levels and at tertiary institutions. The skills acquired in computational and algorithmic thinking is a way of getting to a solution through clear definition of the steps leading to solutions. These skills are needed to embrace a rapidly changing technological landscape.

<img src="/images/comp2.png" style="width:300px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> The two-year course at upper secondary level will equip students to:

*   Apply logical reasoning and algorithmic thinking in analysing problem situations and developing solutions
*   Develop simple programs through the use of appropriate programming language(s)
*   Understand how and where information communications technology (ICT) is used in daily life
*   Understand and explain the ethical, social and economic issues associated with ICT.

ICT refers broadly to technology involving computing devices, software and other hardware. The computer science concepts and skills will also be taught.  

#### Computing Curriculum Framework

For more information on the subject, please refer to the syllabus available at [https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/olevel/2022syllabus/7155\_y22\_sy.pdf](https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/olevel/2022syllabus/7155_y22_sy.pdf).

#### Eco-system to cultivate students' interest in computing


<img src="/images/comp4.png" style="width:300px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> Currently, the school has an eco-system to build and cultivate students’ interest in computing. The school has a CCA in [Science & Technology Club](https://staging.d28t49xsr05e29.amplifyapp.com/co-curricular-activities/Clubs-and-Societies/permalink) with diverse selection of STEM workshops and challenges are provided for students to extend their scientific capabilities and interest and to develop coding and programming skills.

In addition, the Code for Fun Programme is offered as a post examination enrichment to **all Sec 1** students to increase their **exposure to coding and computational thinking**. This is part of a set of mathematical enrichment activities designed to nurture students’ interest in STEM and to develop their disposition in STEM. Students will use microcontrollers, basic drag and drop coding and cardboard Lego Blocks known as Blokies to build different physical structures based on their understanding of mathematical/STEM skills such as spatial visualisation, geometry and measurement. For example, they will write a program to create a house intruder system for their ‘house’ made from Blokies.

And as part of our **Blended Learning at the lower secondary levels** started this semester, **Data Visualisation with Python** is currently offered as a Student-Initiated Learning activity for the Secondary 2 Express and 2 NA students. Students use PyCharm (Python programming) to familiarise themselves with syntax-based programming concepts, including understanding Python language syntax, developing basic capabilities to explore and learn about Python data analytics models, and understanding coding fundamentals such as loops, events, conditionals, variables, etc.

In 2022, ‘Coding With Python’ workshop was offered for all Secondary 2 Express and 2 Normal Academic students. The workshop was conducted online and includes the following: 

*   use of Python programming to design data analytics models;
*   hands-on and experiential project-based learning; and
*   application on mathematics computational thinking
