### Objectives

The **K**ranjians **E**x**P**lore, **LE**arn and **R**esearch (KEPLER) programme is a progressive Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) talent development programme that complements the school’s core Science and Mathematics curriculum.

Through the programme, students will:

*   Gain greater appreciation and understanding of knowledge in the STEM disciplines beyond the curriculum 
*   Develop dispositions and skills to inquire and innovate to solve real-world problems 
*   Be empowered to champion STEM beyond school 
*   Be encouraged to explore STEM-related post-secondary pathways

### Key Programmes 

**KEPLER Learning Modules**

* Provides progressive training for all students who are interested in STEM to prepare them for higher tier KEPLER Challenges
*   Building on their STEM knowledge from the curriculum, students can choose to embark on one of the three tracks under the KEPLER Learning Modules (Enrichment, Research, Programming). They can do so at any point in their Kranji journey, as early as when they enter Secondary 1. 
*   On each track, students first undertake learning modules or experiences for exposure and to deepen their knowledge and skills. Then, they complete a project task to be assessed by their teachers in the school. Successful completion of the modules will depend on students’ demonstrated attitude and understanding.

**KEPLER Challenges**

*   Students who complete the KEPLER Learning Modules will be prioritised for participation in the higher tier KEPLER Challenges. 
*   At this tier, structured mentoring is provided by teachers and/or scientist partners to support students through more intellectually stimulating and challenging tasks.

**Fun Fact: Who is KEPLER?**

Johannes Kepler was a German astronomer and mathematician who discovered the elliptical orbits of planets around the sun, developed the fundamental laws of planetary motion and did important work in optics and geometry.

Kepler exhibited the values, ethics and attitudes in science that we hope to inculcate in our students: curiosity, creativity, integrity, objectivity, open-mindedness, resilience, responsibility and healthy skepticism.
