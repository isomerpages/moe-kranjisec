### Objective

The objective of talent development is to help students nurture and develop interests, strengths, and potential, so that they may become future-ready leaders with a heart to serve.

#### **Members of the programme are developed through:**

*   **Structured Mentoring**: each student will be assigned a teacher as his/her personal mentor whom they can approach for academic guidance and advice, insights into careers and developmental plans.
*   **Skills-based Workshops:** students will enjoy public speaking courses and interview skills preparation
*   **MP Attachment**: talents could be attached to a Member of Parliament during the Meet-the-People Sessions to gain insights of the real concerns of the community. (pending)
