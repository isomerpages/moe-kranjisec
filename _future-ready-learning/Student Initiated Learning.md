### Objectives of Programme

When Student Initiated Learning (SIL) was first introduced in 2021, it provided students with dedicated time and space during their fortnightly Home-Based Learning (HBL) to explore their areas of interests by initiating learning activities on their own.

Key purpose: 

*   Encourage students to exercise self-directedness in their learning
*   Explore beyond the curriculum to pursue areas of passion
*   Ignite Joy of Learning in students 
*   Inculcate a spirit of lifelong learning that will see students through their adult-life
