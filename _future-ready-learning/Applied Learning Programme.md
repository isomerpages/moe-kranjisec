The Applied Learning Programme allows students to develop a user-centric lens in analysing authentic sustainable living issues, identify opportunities for improvement and design creative solutions to address sustainability-related issues. The ALP focus on sustainable living deepens students’ knowledge of nine of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) covered in the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which have been broadly categorised into three broad areas - Physical Environment, Resources and People. Through its myriad exciting programmes, Kranji’s ALP serves to equip students with future-ready skills while advancing Singapore’s national agenda on sustainable development.

## Key Programmes

#### Think, INquire in Kranji’ (THINK) for Sustainability Programme
    
Kranjians learn about the UN SDGs covering sustainability topics such as biodiversity, sustainable management of resources and impacts of climate change through the curriculum, exhibitions and learning journeys. They also acquire critical thinking, design thinking, prototyping and communication skills through a sustainability lens.

The Green Ambassadors also take part in the National Parks Board (NParks) Greening Schools for Biodiversity Programme, where they support environmental sustainability through the development of a pollinator-friendly habitat in the school garden. The students also embarked on planting edible crops in the garden to support Singapore in strengthening our food security.
