#### Learning for Life Programme - Community and Youth Leadership

Kranji Secondary School’s Learning For Life Programme aspires to nurture a leader in every Kranjian through Community and Youth Leadership programmes. 

The school’s LLP programme provides Kranjians with leadership and learning experiences that support their development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. These learning experiences aim to increase the awareness and opportunities for a Kranjian to be of service to others, fulfilling the vision of developing Kranjian with a Heart to Serve.

#### Principles of Leadership

The following principles guide the Kranji Student Leadership Programme:  

 *   Leadership can be taught and learned by all Kranjians.
 *   Kranjians take ownership of their leadership learning progress and development.
 *   Leadership must be grounded in values, character and a desire in the student leaders to serve his/her community.

Kranji Secondary School adopts the Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership Model (Leadership Challenge Model). The Leadership Challenge Model advocates that these five leadership practices are within the capacity of everyone to learn:

1. Model the way
2. Inspire a shared vision
3. Challenge the process
4. Enable others to act
5. Encourage the heart

#### Student Leadership Tiers

The School’s Leadership structure aims to allow every Kranjian an opportunity to develop their leadership capabilities.

##### Tier 1: Self Leadership

Every Kranjian is encouraged to develop their leadership capabilities through exposure to the mindset that leadership can be learned. The school’s Leadership programme accomplishes this through conducting level workshops designed by teachers certified in the Leadership Challenge Model ® and facilitated by class mentors. They also undergo strength profiling workshops to discover their individual strengths.
		 
##### Tier 2: School Leadership

Students are encouraged to serve in their classes and communities through the Class Committee and Values-In-Action (VIA) opportunities. Student Councillors, Peer Support Leaders, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Leaders and House Leaders go through additional trainings to equip them with skills to organise, plan, lead and manage conflict at the group or school levels. Training at this tier aims to equip Student leaders with the ability to influence and impact the general school population. 

Training at this tier aims to equip Student Leaders with the ability to influence and impact the general school population. Leaders at this level undergo more rigorous training in the Leadership Challenge Model® and Project Management which allows them to practice skills learnt during the planning and execution of various school and community- wide events.

##### Tier 3: Community Leadership

Students are given opportunities to serve their community, such as by planning and facilitating in Cluster Leadership Workshop for Primary School student leaders, and at Post-National Day Rally Dialogues. They are also encouraged to identify needs and initiate projects which benefits the community.
		 
#### Student Leadership Distinctive Programmes

###### Voices for Youth: National Day Rally Youth Dialogue  

Voices of Youth 2019 is an annual post-National Day Rally Dialogue organised by the Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. This dialogue aims to provide a platform for youths from the community to offer their views and opinions on initiatives shared by the Prime Minister during the National Day Rally. It also hopes to deepen youths’ interest, knowledge and insight on current affairs, as well as understand the trade-off in policy-making. 

As part of our Student Leadership and National Education programme, our students serve as Facilitators to engage the participating youths, guiding them in sharing and consolidating their views and opinions on the various National Day Rally topics. Our students interacted with participants from other schools, drawing out multiple perspectives and viewpoints, raising awareness and helping them to gain a deeper understanding of the issues raised.

#### Mid-Autumn Festival @ Limbang

The Mid-Autumn Festival @ Limbang is an annual community event jointly organised by the Limbang Grassroots Organisations and Kranji Secondary School. Students from the Student Council and various CCAs come together with the Limbang residents and Mr Lawrence Wong (Minister for Finance) to celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival through fun games and cultural performances.

Our student leaders from the Student Council formed part of the Organising Team, planning and implementing game booths to promote community bonding and engagement. They brainstormed for game ideas based on Mid-Autumn traditions and presented them to representatives from the Limbang Grassroots Organisations. Students from NPCC set up a scam prevention game booth which was extremely popular with residents.

In 2021, Mid-Autumn Festival was held virtually as a Facebook live session. Our Student Council prepared a video to provide fun facts and information regarding the festival. Our Kranji Choir and Kranji Chinese Dance Society pre-recorded performances to engage the audience, in adherence to SMM, and students from NPCC prepared a short skit to educate residents on keeping a lookout for suspicious bags and articles in public places.

 
#### Cluster Primary School Leadership Workshop

This is an annual leadership training programme by Kranji Secondary for our Cluster Primary School student leaders which first started in 2015. Our student leaders take on the roles of mentors to nurture the potential of our young student leaders, empowering them to lead as leaders, equipping them with the Five Exemplary Leadership Practices of the Leadership Challenge Model® by Kouzes and Posner.
