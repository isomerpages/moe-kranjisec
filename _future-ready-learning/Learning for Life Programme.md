#### Learning for Life Programme - Community and Youth Leadership

Kranji Secondary School’s Learning For Life Programme aspires to nurture a leader in every Kranjian through Community and Youth Leadership programmes. 

The school’s LLP programme provides Kranjians with leadership and learning experiences that support their development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. These learning experiences aim to increase the awareness and opportunities for a Kranjian to be of service to others, fulfilling the vision of developing Kranjian with a Heart to Serve.

#### Principles of Leadership

The following principles guide the Kranji Student Leadership Programme:  

 *   Leadership can be taught and learned by all Kranjians.
 *   Kranjians take ownership of their leadership learning progress and development.
 *   Leadership must be grounded in values, character and a desire in the student leaders to serve his/her community.

Kranji Secondary School adopts the Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership Model (Leadership Challenge Model). The Leadership Challenge Model advocates that these five leadership practices are within the capacity of everyone to learn:

1. Model the way
2. Inspire a shared vision
3. Challenge the process
4. Enable others to act
5. Encourage the heart

#### Student Leadership Tiers

The School’s Leadership structure aims to allow every Kranjian an opportunity to develop their leadership capabilities.

##### Tier 1: Self Leadership

Every Kranjian is encouraged to develop their leadership capabilities through exposure to the mindset that leadership can be learned. The school’s Leadership programme accomplishes this through conducting level workshops designed by teachers certified in the Leadership Challenge Model ® and facilitated by class mentors. They also undergo strength profiling workshops to discover their individual strengths.
		 
##### Tier 2: School Leadership

Students are encouraged to serve in their classes and communities through the Class Committee and Values-In-Action (VIA) opportunities. Student Councillors, Peer Support Leaders, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Leaders and House Leaders go through additional trainings to equip them with skills to organise, plan, lead and manage conflict at the group or school levels. Training at this tier aims to equip Student leaders with the ability to influence and impact the general school population. 

Training at this tier aims to equip Student Leaders with the ability to influence and impact the general school population. Leaders at this level undergo more rigorous training in the Leadership Challenge Model® and Project Management which allows them to practice skills learnt during the planning and execution of various school and community- wide events.

##### Tier 3: Community Leadership

Students are given opportunities to serve their community, such as by planning and facilitating in Cluster Leadership Workshop for Primary School student leaders, and at Post-National Day Rally Dialogues. They are also encouraged to identify needs and initiate projects which benefits the community.

Co-organised with the Limbang Youth Network, this dialogue brings youths from the community to discuss their views on initiatives shared by the Prime Minister during the National Day Rally. Our students from the Student Council and Talent Development programme were group facilitators, and led youths from Assumption English School, Regent Secondary and our school in discussing how they can contribute to the ForwardSG movement. They then engaged in a dialogue with the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Finance and Adviser to Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC (Limbang), Mr Lawrence Wong.

*West 6 Cluster Primary School Leadership Workshop*

An annual leadership training programme that first started in 2015, our Student Councillors take on the roles of mentors to nurture the young student leaders from the primary schools in our cluster, as we equipped them with the Five Exemplary Leadership Practices of the Leadership Challenge Model® by Kouzes and Posner, as well as advocacy for social causes.
