The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready.

Under the NDLP, every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD). Students may use funds from their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.
