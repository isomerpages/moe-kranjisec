The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready.

Under the NDLP, every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD). Students may use funds from their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.

### Personal Learning Device (PLD)

The students will be using the PLD for...
1. in class and out-of-class learning. This is to promote active learning and greater personalisation. In class, the devices will be used to support learning of the curriculum subjects independently or collaboratively. Beyond the classroom, students will be able to use the device for home-based learning. 
2. alternative assessments/ authentic learning tasks that require research, digital creation, and collaborative learning
3. ICT training courses
4. Interdisciplinary project based learning

The school chose the device because of: 
* Portability 
* Durability
* T&L Affordances:
	* touch screen 
	* use of stylus pen to write (Inking function) 
	* typing using keyboard
	* video recording
	* multimedia editing

### Financial Assistance

Subsidies are available to students who require financial assistance. Singapore Citizens who are already on MOE FAS will automatically qualify for these subsidies and do not need to take any action.

Permanent Residents (PR) and International Students (IS) who need support can apply for subsidies, particularly those whose Gross Household Income (GHI) is below $4400 or Per Capita Income (PCI) is below $1100. Please approach the school for more details.
