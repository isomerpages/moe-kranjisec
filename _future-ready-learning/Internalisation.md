Internationalisation is an important thrust under MOE’s Learn for Life Agenda. The Internationalisation Programme is our school’s vehicle to provide our students with different opportunities to understand the histories, cultures, and economies of countries around the world, particularly those in Asia, and these countries’ interconnections with Singapore. Despite travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual platforms have provided us with the means to create global classrooms and replicate internationalisation experiences without stepping beyond our shores.

### The Education for Sustainable Development Award – First Prize winner

The Education for Sustainable Development Award recognises education and learning that promotes sustainable development. In 2021, the theme was “Securing Educational Opportunities in COVID-19 Crisis” and we were one of the 282 schools from eight Southeast Asian countries which submitted entries for this award. Due to our strong internationalisation efforts, we were named the First Prize winner of the Education for Sustainable Development Award, which was presented by the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.

The Ministry of Education has featured our e-internationalisation programmes on schoolbag, a news website that provides parents, educators and the general public with education news, school features and tips. The article “The World is my Classroom” narrates our school’s approach in continuing to provide our students with an international experience despite the COVID-19 situation and the rich learning that student participants had obtained from this programme.

### ASEAN Symposium

One of our key internationalisation programmes is the ASEAN Symposium, which is conducted in partnership with the Institute of South East Asian Studies–ASEAN Studies Centre. It provides our students with a dialogue platform to discuss ASEAN-related issues with policymakers and academic representatives, and learn more about the opportunities and challenges facing ASEAN through case studies and research projects.

The 2022 Symposium theme was “The Future of ASEAN”. It aimed to engage today’s youth on the longstanding and current issues and challenges that ASEAN faces, and to propose solutions to overcome them. While ASEAN member states have made significant progress in attaining their United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), more needs to be done in areas such as environmental sustainability.  The symposium therefore challenged students to work together to propose solutions for the future they envision for ASEAN. Over 700 students from 70 Secondary Schools attended the two-day virtual symposium. Students from our partner schools in the Philippines and Thailand also participated and shared rich and diverse perspectives on their countries’ efforts to achieve the UNSDGs.

In addition, virtual school exchanges with overseas school partners have allowed us to scale up our internationalisation efforts as more students are now able to benefit from an extended internationalisation experience. Recurring virtual school exchanges have also allowed us to overcome the constraint posed by physical school exchanges, wherein the interactions with our partner schools are limited to a visit of less than a week. Through synchronous and asynchronous interactions with peers from around the world, our students learn more about their cultures and collaborate on meaningful projects that enhance their global awareness and cross-cultural skills.
