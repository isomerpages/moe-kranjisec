Internationalisation is an important thrust under MOE’s Learn for Life Agenda. The Internationalisation Programme is our school’s vehicle to provide our students with different opportunities to understand the histories, cultures, and economies of countries around the world, particularly those in Asia, and these countries’ interconnections with Singapore. Despite travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual platforms have provided us with the means to create global classrooms and replicate internationalisation experiences without stepping beyond our shores.

### The Education for Sustainable Development Award – First Prize winner

The Education for Sustainable Development Award recognises education and learning that promotes sustainable development. In 2021, the theme was “Securing Educational Opportunities in COVID-19 Crisis” and we were one of the 282 schools from eight Southeast Asian countries which submitted entries for this award. Due to our strong internationalisation efforts, we were named the First Prize winner of the Education for Sustainable Development Award, which was presented by the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.
