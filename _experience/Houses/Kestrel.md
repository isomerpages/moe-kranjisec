### Kestrel

As we rise above the rest, we leave a trail. A trail that you tail. Follow our trail, don’t be frail. Follow our trail, rest assured, you won’t fail.


Motto: **RISE ABOVE THE REST**

Our rings, you will hear.  
Hearts race as we chant our cheers.  
Our message is clear.  
  
Klee-Klee-Klee we ring.  
A good fight to the table,  
We, for sure, will bring.  
  
Mini mighty spunk  
Borrowed from Falcons, you’d think.  
Our spirit’s distinct.  
  
Brace yourself, you’ll hear.  
Come join us, the flight is near.  
Kestrel, We don’t fear
