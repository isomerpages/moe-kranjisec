The **Values-In-Action (VIA)** Programme in Kranji Secondary School is a 4/5-year programme based on the developmental needs of the students while aiming to positively benefit the community around the school. It seeks to nurture empathetic and responsible students that will contribute meaningfully back to the community through the development of values, knowledge and skills. 

To raise students’ awareness of the broader issues which Singapore faces, students will cover 6 different modules in Lower Secondary before embarking on a class-initiated VIA in Upper Secondary. Through these initiatives, students will participate in a range of activities to raise awareness and take action to make a positive difference to the school and the larger community.
