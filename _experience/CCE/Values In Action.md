The **Values-In-Action (VIA)** Programme in Kranji Secondary School is a 4/5-year programme based on the developmental needs of the students while aiming to positively benefit the community around the school. It seeks to nurture empathetic and responsible students that will contribute meaningfully back to the community through the development of values, knowledge and skills. 

To raise students’ awareness of the broader issues which Singapore faces, students will cover 6 different modules in Lower Secondary before embarking on a class-initiated VIA in Upper Secondary. Through these initiatives, students will participate in a range of activities to raise awareness and take action to make a positive difference to the school and the larger community.

Through these VIA initiatives, students learn and exhibit leadership, organisational and communication skills, which are also transferable to other areas in the holistic education.

**CCA VIA**

Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) are also strongly encouraged to take on VIA experiences as well. They can contribute back to the community and use their specific strengths to impact the beneficiaries. In the process, students will also develop a greater sense of empathy and care as they grow together as a CCA unit.
