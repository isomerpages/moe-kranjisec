## Goal
Our school’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme aims to develop future-ready leaders with a heart to serve through a student-centric and coherent curriculum anchored on values and socio-emotional competencies. 

## Programme

Students learn about CCE mainly through CCE lessons and Student Development Experiences, among others.

* **CCE Lessons**: Taking place once per week, teachers engage and build relationship with their students through discussions and effective classroom strategies.
* **Student Development Experiences**:   These include programmes such as Values-in-Action and Cohort Learning Journeys. It also includes school-based initiatives such as the Active Citizens Modules. These contribute towards the holistic development of our students and take place during weekly Assembly or after school.

## Content Areas

The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships, and Choices, and comprises the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students.

These fundamentals are taught and applied in the Curriculum Content Areas, such as:
* Education and Career Guidance
* National Education
* Sexuality Education
* Values in Action
