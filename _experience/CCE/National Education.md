National Education in Kranji Secondary School fosters in students a sense of identity, pride and self-respect as Singaporeans. By providing meaningful learning experiences, the school endeavours to inculcate a sense of rootedness and belonging to the school and Singapore.

> “The parade was amazing, everyone worked hard. The different programmes are fun and I feel a sense of belonging.”

Chia Jia En, 4K1

> “I like that it educated us on the importance of Racial Harmony instead of the festive atmosphere which we usually have.”

Tan Xuan En Jasiel, 1N

Through discussions of contemporary issues, developmental lessons, citizenship experiences and celebration of four core annual events, students are guided in exploring and examining their Singapore identity. 

Annual Events under National Education:

*   Total Defence Day Commemoration
*   International Friendship Day
*   Racial Harmony Day Commemoration
*   National Day Celebration
