# Goals of ECG

In Kranji Secondary School, we aim to equip our students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values so that they are future ready. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning, ECG helps students develop a growth mindset, adaptability and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate all occupations across society.

Through CCE ECG Lessons and key Student Development Experiences, students discover their interests and aspirations, and learn to make informed decisions about their future education and career pathways, through the following Core ECG Questions:

1.  Who am I?
2.  Where do I want to go?
3.  How do I get there?

**CCE ECG Lessons**

Students in all levels undergo CCE ECG Lessons, which take reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 syllabus. These lessons are part of the curriculum and they provide students with the knowledge and skills they need in order to make decisions about their future education and career pathways. For example, students learn about how they could make career decisions by gaining clarity on their Values, Interests, Personality and Skills (VIPS) and using the Career Decision Wheel.

**Guiding Principles for ECG Student Development Experiences (SDEs):**

1.  Student-Centricity – SDEs are planned based on students’ needs, interests and aspirations. We focus on facilitating student engagement and voice, and empower students to take charge of their ECG learning.
2.  Intentionality – SDEs are planned with specific learning outcomes in mind.
3.  Coherence – SDEs enable students to connect, transfer, and apply learning across CCE ECG lessons as well as different key student development experiences.
4.  Collaboration – We strive to establish meaningful partnership with parents, alumni, post-secondary education institutions and other industry partners.
