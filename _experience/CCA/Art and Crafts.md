**Art and Craft Club** provides both breadth and depth to facilitate Kranjians’ talents in the visual arts. The members engage in the Arts through visits to museums, taking part in competitions and workshops to gain knowledge, skills and dispositions. They take ownership advocating for the Arts. With the knowledge gained, Art and Craft Club members take the initiative to lead Art programmes to inculcate a sense of service towards the school and community through projects. To celebrate their achievements, platforms are craved to exhibit their artworks through exhibitions and static displays to showcase their talent.

This year, Art Club participated in _SYF goes Online_ to create a representation of how technology has impacted our lives. Despite the COVID-19 situation, Art Club continued its activities via online platforms. The members participated in making mosaic coasters to show their appreciation to the support staff during Teacher’s Day 2020. As part of the extension of the Applied Learning Programme, they made ceramic tiles inspired by our flora and fauna in Kranji Marshes. Upon the resumption of CCA, members took part in mural painting to commemorate Singapore’s 55th National Day. Undeterred, Art Club members continue to harness their talents during these unprecedented times.
