**Art Club** provides both breadth and depth to facilitate Kranjians’ talents in the visual arts. The members engage in the Arts through visits to museums, taking part in competitions and workshops to gain knowledge, skills and dispositions. They take ownership advocating for the Arts. With the knowledge gained, Art and Craft Club members take the initiative to lead Art programmes to inculcate a sense of service towards the school and community through projects. To celebrate their achievements, platforms are craved to exhibit their artworks through exhibitions and static displays to showcase their talent.

Kranji Art Club is proud to be a part of a collaborative project with Limbang Green RC that combines artistic expression with sustainable practices! Our talented Art Club students have dedicated several weeks into designing and painting nostalgic Singapore themed wall murals in the Limbang neighbourhood.The purpose of the murals is to provide a colourful backdrop against the recycled MRT seats which were repurposed for residents to rest. The Limbang residents and our students have actively collaborated to co-create these beautiful murals.

The opening ceremony welcomed the general public, members of the RC and was graced by DPM Mr. Lawrence Wong. Our Art Club Kranjians took great pride in showcasing and presenting the murals and also set up a booth where they taught residents on crafting personalized keychains using recycled materials.

“My experience painting and planning the Limbang murals was really fulfilling. I got to bond with my CCA members and the Limbang residents. I also picked up skills such as public speaking. These skills really helped me in my daily life. It was also a whole new experience for me as we were painting on a wall instead of a canvas, which was much bigger in scale.” - Lim Hui Ler, Esther 3K1

These budding artists also conducted a two-day Art Jamming workshop with Limbang Green residents. They taught participants about basic colour mixing and painting techniques using acrylic paint. Residents completed their beautifully painted sunset scenery masterpieces on canvas.

“I really enjoyed conducting the painting workshop and facilitating the residents. It was a very fruitful experience that allowed residents of Limbang neighborhood to try their hands on painting a sunset scenery. I also really liked interacting and guiding the residents through the process of painting. I hope to engage in more of these workshops in the future!” -Siak Jing Yuan 3K3
