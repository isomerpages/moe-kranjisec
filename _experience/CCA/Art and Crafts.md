<p><strong>Art Club</strong> provides both breadth and depth to facilitate
Kranjians’ talents in the visual arts. The members engage in the Arts through
visits to museums, taking part in competitions and workshops to gain knowledge,
skills and dispositions. They take ownership advocating for the Arts. With
the knowledge gained, Art and Craft Club members take the initiative to
lead Art programmes to inculcate a sense of service towards the school
and community through projects. To celebrate their achievements, platforms
are craved to exhibit their artworks through exhibitions and static displays
to showcase their talent.</p>

<p>Kranji Art Club is proud to be a part of a collaborative project with
Limbang Green RC that combines artistic expression with sustainable practices!
Our talented Art Club students have dedicated several weeks into designing
and painting nostalgic Singapore themed wall murals in the Limbang neighbourhood.The
purpose of the murals is to provide a colourful backdrop against the recycled
MRT seats which were repurposed for residents to rest. The Limbang residents
and our students have actively collaborated to co-create these beautiful
murals.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony welcomed the general public, members of the RC and
was graced by DPM Mr. Lawrence Wong. Our Art Club Kranjians took great
pride in showcasing and presenting the murals and also set up a booth where
they taught residents on crafting personalized keychains using recycled
materials.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>My experience painting and planning the Limbang murals was really fulfilling. I got to bond with my CCA members and the Limbang residents. I also picked up skills such as public speaking. These skills really helped me in my daily life. It was also a whole new experience for me as we were painting on a wall instead of a canvas, which was much bigger in scale.” - Lim Hui Ler, Esther 3K1</h4>

<p>These budding artists also conducted a two-day Art Jamming workshop with
Limbang Green residents. They taught participants about basic colour mixing
and painting techniques using acrylic paint. Residents completed their
beautifully painted sunset scenery masterpieces on canvas.</p>
<p>“I really enjoyed conducting the painting workshop and facilitating the
residents. It was a very fruitful experience that allowed residents of
Limbang neighborhood to try their hands on painting a sunset scenery. I
also really liked interacting and guiding the residents through the process
of painting. I hope to engage in more of these workshops in the future!”
