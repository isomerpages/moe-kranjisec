**Art and Craft Club** provides both breadth and depth to facilitate Kranjians’ talents in the visual arts. The members engage in the Arts through visits to museums, taking part in competitions and workshops to gain knowledge, skills and dispositions. They take ownership advocating for the Arts. With the knowledge gained, Art and Craft Club members take the initiative to lead Art programmes to inculcate a sense of service towards the school and community through projects. To celebrate their achievements, platforms are craved to exhibit their artworks through exhibitions and static displays to showcase their talent.

Reflection by Chantelle Lee, 3K3

> This year, we have participated in competitions such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2022, Live On Design Competition and Design Hackathon. The most impactful for me would be the SYF competition. The SYF theme this year is Artist and Sustainability. I collaborated with another member to visually present what it means to sustain our cultural identity as Singaporeans and what shapes it. We identified that harmonious living is key- understanding and respecting each other’s ethnic cultures. We did an oil painting of the different ethnicities to suggest the idea of piecing up different cultures and sustaining our cultural identity. Our artworks attained recognition and we were awarded Certificate of Achievement. The experience of having our artworks exhibited at the National Museum of Singapore left an indelible experience for us. Art and Craft Club was also invited by Singapore Wildcat Action Group to create artworks for an exhibition in conjunction with an event to screen a documentary by Layar Liar at the Projector. We did paintings, posters, prints of tigers and tiger protectors to reflect our thoughts on the dwindling numbers of tiger population and as means to pay tribute to those protecting them. After three years of hiatus due to COVID-19, we finally went on learning journeys to the Art Science Museum and National Museum Singapore to immerse ourselves with an artistic atmosphere. We also designed tote bags to show our appreciation to our teachers and EAS. These activities have allowed the members of our Art and Craft Club to explore the wonderful world of art and pick up several skills and values to further enrich our school lives.
