<h3>Table Tennis</h3>
<p><strong>Kranji Table Tennis</strong> is the only CCA in the school that
is comprised of an all-girls team. The CCA aims to develop disciplined
and resilient players who are motivated to achieve the best outcomes and
exhibit excellent sportsmanship. They consistently level up their skills
in the sport through rigorous drills, one-to-one single or doubles coaching,
sparring with peers during training sessions. Every year, the team will
represent the school in National School Games NSG tournaments as well as
friendly matches with other schools. Team members are also presented with
opportunities to develop their leadership potential as they hone their
skills and strive towards the collective goals of the team.</p>
