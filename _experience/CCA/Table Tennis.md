### Table Tennis

**Kranji Table Tennis** is the only CCA in the school that is comprised of an all-girls team. The CCA aims to develop disciplined and resilient players who are motivated to achieve the best outcomes and exhibit excellent sportsmanship. They consistently level up their skills in the sport through rigorous drills, one-to-one single or doubles coaching, sparring with peers during training sessions. Every year, the team will represent the school in National School Games (NSG) West Zone Table Tennis tournaments, intraschool competitive games as well as friendly matches with other schools. Team members are also presented with opportunities to develop their leadership potential as they hone their skills and strive towards the collective goals of the team.
