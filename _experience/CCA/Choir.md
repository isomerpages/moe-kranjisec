### Kranji Choir

Since its official inception in 2000,&nbsp;Kranji Choir&nbsp;has grown in strength and ability, with consistently good performance at the Singapore Youth Festival over the years. With its vision ‘Lift Every Voice, Sing and Rejoice’, Kranji Choir has performed on multiple platforms, both internally at school events and externally at various public events, and was most recently invited to perform at the Limbang National Day Dinner and&nbsp;A Little Singing Festival&nbsp;at School of the Arts (SOTA).

The choir seeks to develop its members as singers, individuals and performers through a holistic learning experience, with a focus on musical development, character building and a Kranjian identity. Members of Kranji Choir will have the opportunity to develop and showcase their performance and leadership skills. With a group of dedicated teachers and instructors looking into high quality training, and a strong following of alumni who return regularly to support the CCA, Kranji Choir has grown from strength to strength, and continues striving for all-round development and excellence in all its undertakings.
