### Malay Culture and Language

The **Malay Cultural and Language Society** aims to develop students’ potential and abilities through Malay cultural activities as well as to provide a platform for them to cultivate a deep appreciation and strong passion for the Malay culture and to show case their talents. MCLS also aims to develop students’ talents in various niche areas such as Dikir Barat (sing-a-long and hand-movements’ dance) and Kompang (Malay Drums ensemble) and poetry recitation. Members are provided with opportunities to work with a well-known external instructor to improve their vocal abilities, play Malay percussions well and write song lyrics of high quality.  
  
MCLS has added a new dimension to Kranji Secondary School programme. As such, all interested students of any background or skill level are welcome to join MCLS. There are multiple platforms for members to perform on stage, such as the annual Hari Raya Concert, school and community events and the combined public concert for all Performing Arts CCAs. MCLS will create an environment for all members to learn the importance of teamwork by providing platforms for strong rapport to be formed among the members. Throughout the course of their participation, members will explore the various facets of Malay culture through activities involving music, dance, and the visual arts.

"I joined the Malay Cultural Society (MCS) CCA in 2020. At first, I did not enjoy participating activities as there are many things to remember such as the hand movements, the songs and the various beat of the Kompang. Later, I learned how to overcome those difficulties with the help of the instructor and start to enjoy the activities it even more. I am always excited for our next training session. The CCA also taught us some fun facts about Dikir Barat. I am glad that school decided to make MCS as a CCA in this school."  <br>**Mohamed Indra Wira Bin Mohamed Rashid 2R2 (Vice-president)**

"I am honoured to be appointed as the President of the Malay Cultural Society (MCS) CCA this year. During the Dikir Barat training sessions, the instructor taught us how to sing the songs and how to do the hand movements. We also learned to play the Kompang. I am always looking forward to attend the trainings as I am able to interact with my CCA members well. We put up the Hari Raya Celebrations, National Day Celebrations, Teachers’ Day Celebrations and the Limbang Constituency Festival Day performances, this year. We always had a fun time preparing for these performances. This CCA teaches me the importance of being respectful and working together as a group."  <br>**Nur Syaza Natasya Binte Azman 3A1 (President)**
