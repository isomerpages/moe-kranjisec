### Kranji Modern Dance Club

Kranji Modern Dance Club (KMDC) strives to develop well-rounded dancers and maximise the potential of each dancer, with exposure to different genres such as Contemporary, Jazz, Hip-hop and Ballet dances. The dancers are also given opportunities to work with different external instructors and choreographers to broaden their horizon and enrich their movement vocabulary, as well as given training in choreography techniques and make-up skills.&nbsp;

KMDC is known for its great discipline and camaraderie, and functions at a high level of self-efficacy and student autonomy. There is immense focus on the positive learning attitude and character development of every dancer, on top of skills acquisition and performance quality, to enable them to push their limits and achieve greater heights. There are opportunities for our members to widen their exposure to different dance genres and witness the adaptability, creativity, and unity of performers when they attend dance competitions and professional dancers' performances.

There are multiple platforms for the dancers to perform on stage, such as Dance Camp Showcase, Inter-school Dance Exchange and Dimensions X – a KMDC Alumni dance production. KMDC supports community events such as Limbang National Day Dinner and in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. With the support from our school leaders, teachers, instructors, alumni and family members, KMDC has been awarded the Certificate of Distinction for SYF 2023!

### Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation&nbsp;

Our Kranji Modern Dance club dancers worked really hard and overcame all challenges faced during the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation International Dance Category. Our dancers exhibited tenacity and discipline throughout the weeks of rigorous training in preparation for the presentations and gave their best on the day of the presentations.

**Student Reflections:**

&gt; ‘This year’s SYF item was not easy due to the challenging dance moves and synchronized team efforts to pull off our dance instructor’s choreography. I am grateful to our instructor, Mr Peter Teo, for his guidance as I assisted the team with the blockings and shared feedback to our dancers, to help improve their steps. I am extremely proud of our dancers for putting in their best efforts and achieving distinction!’&nbsp;

&gt; ‘This amazing experience would not be possible without the support from our school leaders, teachers, parents, and friends. The guidance from our dance instructor, Mr Peter Teo, throughout our SYF preparation was invaluable. Our teachers, Ms Karen Wong, Ms Cynthia Wong and Ms Lim Leck Lee, was there to support us in our emotional well-being and ensured our safety through our preparations! We are also grateful for the unwavering support and encouragement we have received from family and friends.’&nbsp;

- Hayley Ho (4K4), 2022/2023 KMDC Vice-President

&gt; ‘I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to each of our talented dancers in our SYF team for their hard work, dedication, and passion that led us to achieving Distinction! Congratulations dancers, you have persevered and made everything worth it! Continue to work hard and together as one for future performances. The world is our stage!’&nbsp;
