### Kranji Modern Dance Club

**Kranji Modern Dance Club (KMDC)** strives to develop well-rounded dancers and maximise the potential of each dancer, with exposure to different genres such as Contemporary, Jazz, Hip-hop and Ballet dances. The dancers are also given opportunities to work with different external instructors and choreographers to broaden their horizon and enrich their movement vocabulary, as well as given training in choreography techniques and make-up skills.

KMDC is known for its great discipline and camaraderie, and functions at a high level of self-efficacy and student autonomy. There is immense focus on the positive learning attitude and character development of every dancer, on top of skills acquisition and performance quality, to enable them to push their limits and achieve greater heights. There are multiple platforms for the dancers to perform on stage, such as Dimensions II – a KMDC dance production, Dance Camp Showcase, school and community events and the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. With a strong following of alumni who return regularly to support the club, KMDC has grown from strength to strength, and continues striving for all-round development and excellence in all its undertakings.

### Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 

Despite the many restrictions due to Covid-19 measures, our Kranji Modern Dance club dancers worked really hard and overcame all challenges faced during the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation International Dance Category. Our dancers exhibited tenacity and discipline throughout the weeks of rigorous training in preparation for the presentations and gave their best on the day of the presentations.

### Dimensions II

Dimensions II is a KMDC Dance production. It provides a platform for our CCA members to gain stage experience, strengthen communication skills and relationships with each other. Our dancers have invested much time and effort, amidst the challenges faced during this pandemic. It is also an important event for our members to showcase their passion in dance as they can express themselves through their own choreographed dance items.

> ‘Kranji Modern Dance Club has given us many opportunities to showcase our potential and growth as dancers. With the support from my instructor, teachers and peers, I was able to apply my creativity and skills and choreograph a dance item titled ‘Swim’. KMDC provides a safe space for dancers, with various levels of experience, to improve themselves and achieve their best. This is made possible with the rigorous training and discipline in our club and also to the wide exposure to a variety of dance genres. Our dancers strive and push beyond their limits, working together as a family like how we always do. Make everything worth it KMDC! The world is our stage!’
