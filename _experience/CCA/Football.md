### Football

The **Kranji Football Team** strives to develop boys with discipline, resilience and school pride. Through the rigorous physical and tactical training sessions, the boys develop a deeper understanding into the game as well as hone their own physical and technical skills. They also grow closer as a team and have the opportunity to display their leadership and communication skills on and off the field.
