### National Police Cadet Corps

The **National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC)** Unit aims to develop students in their character, leadership and resilience. Our cadets are exposed to unique opportunities to gain exposure and familiarity with Singapore’s crime prevention efforts to build a Safe and Secure Home. Through a myriad of activities, values such as discipline, loyalty, integrity, resourcefulness, tenacity and civic-consciousness are inculcated to develop them into Caring and Responsible Citizens. Cadets have opportunities to participate in activities such as Drills, Campcraft, Physical Training & Games, Marksmanship, Outdoor Adventure & Survival Skills and First Aid.
