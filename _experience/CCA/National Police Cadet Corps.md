### National Police Cadet Corps

The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) Unit aims to develop students in their character, leadership and resilience. Our cadets are exposed to unique opportunities to gain exposure and familiarity with Singaporeâ€™s crime prevention efforts to build a Safe and Secure Home. Through a myriad of activities, values such as discipline, loyalty, integrity, resourcefulness, tenacity and civic-consciousness are inculcated to develop them into Caring and Responsible Citizens. Cadets have opportunities to participate in activities such as Drills, Campcraft, Physical Training &amp; Games, Marksmanship, Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) visit, Outdoor Adventure &amp; Survival Skills and First Aid.


1.  Drills allow students to learn basic commands and to build resilience.
