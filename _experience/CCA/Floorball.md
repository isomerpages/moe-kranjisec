### Floorball

**Kranji Floorball Boys and Girls** aims to build a culture of excellence through passion, dedication and commitment. Our training focuses on developing players’ technical skills and conditioning such as fast reflexes and precision techniques. 

Through the sport, we would like to inculcate values such as a positive mental attitude, good sportsmanship and cohesive teamwork in a respectful and learning environment.  

We hope to achieve greater heights in time to come and look forward to participating in the National School Games.
