<h3>Floorball</h3>
<p>Kranji Floorball Boys and Girls&nbsp;aims to build a culture of excellence
through passion, dedication&nbsp;and commitment. Our training focuses on
developing playersâ€™ technical skills and conditioning&nbsp;such as fast
reflexes and precision techniques.</p>
<p>Through the sport, we focus on inculcating values such as a positive mental
attitude, good&nbsp;sportsmanship and cohesive teamwork in a respectful
and learning environment.</p>
<p>The floor ballers have been participating in National School Games (both
B Division and C Division for boys and girls) since 2022 and there has
been a notable improvement in results. The tournament has bonded the floor
ballers with a sense of solidarity and togetherness transcending all kinds
of differences. Together they strive to stay resilient and build sportsmanship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With other tournaments like Spectra Floorball Carnival and intermittent
friendly matches round the year, Kranji floor ballers are strengthening
their stamina and skills to excel further and build a culture of vibrant
positivity.</p>
