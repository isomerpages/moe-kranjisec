<p>The second team is an innovative body that provides audio technical support
in various school functions, such as event celebrations and music broadcast.
It provides a platform to equip students who are interested in the technical
aspect of stage production with skills to contribute to the school. Students
are equipped with the skills of setting up and controlling the sound quality
of the equipment and the managing of the event crew.</p>
<p>Both teams also coordinate with other CCAs and lend their support in major
school performances. Both teams have adapt and move on to learn more about
Livestreaming services to better cater to the needs of the school.</p>
<p>Usually the first to set up and the last to terminate its services and
leave, MPT is the unsung hero of the many successes experienced by the
school.</p>
<p><strong>Trainings: Wednesdays and Fridays â€“ 3.45 pm to 5.45 pm<br>Teachers-in-charge: Mr Tan Nian Kai, Ms Sim Yeng Suann, Mr Muhammad Firdaus</strong>

<h5>Reflections</h5>
<p>"<em>Being in the Sound and Stage team of Media &amp; Productions Team, I had the opportunity to experience first-hand how to set up the various sound equipment, and gain a better insight on the technical aspect of what goes on behind the scenes during events like Lunar New Year Celebrations and National Day Celebrations, to name a few. My position as the Vice President for Sound and Stage team also helped hone my leadership and communication skills. I learn to work together with my executive committee team to create a friendly environment for the members to train in, and to plan for meaningful training sessions for them.</em>"</p>
