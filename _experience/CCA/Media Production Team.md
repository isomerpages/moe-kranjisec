<p>To showcase membersâ€™ talents on a national platform, the club participated
in the Schools Digital Media Awards (SDMA) and Our Schools Our Stories.
These competitions provided our members with invaluable opportunities to
receive constructive feedback and gain a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Beyond competitions, we also focused on providing our students with enriching
learning experiences. For example, the club went on learning journey to
Singapore Polytechnic's Media, Arts, and Design School to expose our members
to the exciting world of media, arts and design. This visit inspired our
members to explore their creative potential and gain insights into the
industry. To further hone our skills, the club worked with Canon Imaging
Academy to conduct an Outdoor Levitation Photography Workshop held at Gardens
by the Bay. This unique workshop allowed our students to experiment with
innovative photographic techniques, enhance their technical abilities and
express their creativity in new ways.</p>
