### Kranji Chinese Dance Society

**Kranji Chinese Dance Society (KCDS)** aims to cultivate an appreciation for Chinese culture through the learning of Chinese dance. Through our training sessions, we focus on developing and strengthening our dancers’ skills and techniques, and nurturing them into skilful and graceful Chinese dancers who exude confidence and exhibit good showmanship when dancing.

Our dancers’ experience is also enriched through the learning journey and performance the club organises. Through understanding the different ethnic groups in China and using props such as handkerchiefs, umbrellas and fans, we hope to provide our dancers with a more complete understanding to be more adept in the art of Chinese dance.
