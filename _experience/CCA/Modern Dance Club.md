<h3>Kranji Modern Dance Club</h3>
<p>Kranji Modern Dance Club (KMDC)<strong> </strong>strives to develop well-rounded
dancers and maximise the potential of each dancer, with exposure to different
genres such as Contemporary, Jazz, and Ballet dances. The dancers are also
given opportunities to work with different external instructors and choreographers
to broaden their horizon and enrich their movement vocabulary, as well
as given training in choreography techniques and make-up skills.</p>
<p>KMDC is known for its great discipline and camaraderie, and functions
at a high level of self-efficacy and student autonomy. There is immense
focus on the positive learning attitude and character development of every
dancer, on top of skills acquisition and performance quality, to enable
them to push their limits and achieve greater heights.</p>
<p>This year, there were various platforms for our dancers to showcase their
dance skills, such as our school’s Achievement Day, National Day celebrations
and Teachers’ and EAS Day celebrations and Dance Camp. Our dancers had
the opportunity to perform for the public at Dimensions Xtra – a KMDC Alumni
dance production – and at our school's Performing Arts Combined Concert
'Magical Symphony', where the club presented two dance items: 'Within'
and 'Chapter XIV'. KMDC also supports community events such as the Limbang
National Day Dinner.</p>

<h3><strong>Student Reflections:</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>‘'Within', a dance piece choreographed by our instructor, Mr. Peter, showcases
our dancers’ resilience and empowerment. Despite challenges during rehearsals
and preparations, we persevered. Our hard work culminated in a powerful
display of unity and grace, celebrating the strength within each of us.
I'm grateful for the opportunity to support my peers and juniors. I hope
they continue to grow, support each other, and work together as a team,
embodying our club's motto: 'Team before self'’.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘The Performing Arts Combined Concert was an amazing experience which
wouldn’t have been possible without the support from the school. Together
with Stella, we were fortunate to choreograph a dance piece ‘Chapter XVI’.
It was challenging to ensure that all the Sec 4 dancers would shine on
stage. It portrays our shared struggles and triumphs that unites us as
a batch. Thankfully through our collective teamwork and the guidance of
our instructor and teachers, we managed to pull off a great show!’</p>
