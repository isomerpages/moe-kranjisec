### National Cadet Corps (Land)

The **National Cadet Corps (NCC, Land)** Unit aims to nurture concern and active citizens with a strong sense of resilience, resourcefulness and responsibility in the cadets. During the weekly training, cadets’ have the opportunity to experience challenges that equip them the knowledge, skills and readiness to face the adversity of tomorrow. This enables them to appreciate the importance of military defence to the nation. The cadets also learn to appreciate the importance of precision and teamwork, through the popular Freestyle Drill and Precision Drill which incorporates fun, besides foot drills.
