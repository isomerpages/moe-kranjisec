### National Cadet Corps (Land)

The National Cadet Corps (NCC) Land strives for cadets to be resilient and responsible citizens. The unit started the year on a good note, having attained Distinction in the annual Unit Recognition Award.

The incoming Secondary One cadets were greatly inspired by the Freestyle and Precision Drill Showcases, and the Affirmation Ceremony at NCC Headquarters. Secondary Two cadets visited the SAFRA Yishun Indoor Air Weapons Range for the first time and were captivated by the air weapons displayed. Cadets underwent various enjoyable activities in line with NCC’s philosophy of being strong in body, heart, and mind. At Secondary Three, shortlisted cadets further enhanced their knowledge mastery and instructional abilities at the annual Senior Specialist Leadership Course. Shortlisted Secondary Four Senior Cadet Leaders were affirmed with the NCC Outstanding Cadet Award for their excellent leadership and contributions.

Cadets who attended the International Maritime Defence Exhibition Asia 2023 were impressed with the maritime defence capabilities, latest military technology and the opportunities within the defence industry. Enlistment Day at the Basic Military Training Centre at Pulau Tekong serves to reinforce commitment to Defence and National Service (NS) and for cadets to appreciate the significance of NS. The cadets’ hard work also paid off and culminated in a successful NDP Parade 2023. The Sports Championship and Dragon Boating allowed cadets to build up their physical fitness and foster great friendships. The Under Siege simulated scenario game-based learning, which allowed cadets to better appreciate SGSecure messages. Cadets also positively impacted the community, as they reached out to residents and raised awareness on the various creative and dedicated strategies.

&gt; Camp STEEL was fascinating! We got to experience situational events, learn about navigation and have fun with paintball! We truly appreciate the opportunities to develop leadership attributes through the various experiences. My fellow cadets and I forged great bonds through these meaningful experiences.

&gt; The Senior Specialist Leadership Course (SSLC) taught us unique and valuable lessons. Initially, working with strangers seemed challenging, but we discovered one another's strengths and weaknesses, collaborated effectively and supported one another. SSLC made us adaptable and sociable, contributing to our personal growth.

&gt; As the Parade Commander, it was a challenging yet fulfilling and rewarding experience. It taught me valuable life skills, and emphasized the collaborative nature of leadership. Effective communication and adaptability were key to engage the various uniformed groups and to coordinate the training, rehearsals and the parade. There was spectacular synergy as various CCA leaders and cadets unified towards a common goal and vision. All the time we spent on our drills demonstrated our dedication and our pride to be a part of the school’s National Day Parade 2023.
