### Malay Culture and Language Society (MCLS)

Starting 2023, MCLS has widened its repertoire by focusing on the learning and playing two traditional instruments, namely angklung and kulintang. These instruments originated from Indonesia and are very well known in the Malay Archipelago (Nusantara). Interestingly, the instruments can be played for both traditional and modern popular songs. For the first time in Kranji, the MCLS is making a breakthrough by forming the Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble as a CCA group. With just around less than 20 members, it is important for the group to be cohesive and united to achieve great feats. Just like each angklung represents one note, each member in the CCA group is significantly essential and unique. Hence, they need to come together so that the songs can be beautifully played together. Through their recent debut Hari Raya performance, they have formed a greater bond with each other. Additionally, having teamwork is critical to enable them to achieve a common goal.

#### Key Purpose/ Objectives 

*   To develop students’ potential and abilities in Malay cultural activities and provide a platform for them to cultivate a deep appreciation and strong passion for the Malay culture.
    
*   To develop and showcase students’ talents in Malay traditional instruments, such as Kompang, Angklung and Kulintang, to enable them to take part in any school related and external performances, and eventually ready for the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for Instrumental Ensemble (by 2025).
    
*   To enable students to learn and apply good musicianship and values of respect, resilience, teamwork, and discipline.
   
Students’ reflections

> My experience in MCLS this year has been amazing. I get to learn how to play a new instrument which is the angklung. Not only that, but I also get to learn the music western notations which not many schools offer in their angklung ensemble. Thus, I am grateful for the lessons that I am given which I can use in the future. Lastly, I get to work with the juniors from Secondary One which was a blast because I get to meet new people and be able to spend time with them. Performing with them for Hari Raya was really something I am grateful for as it has helped me to overcome the fear of performing on the stage. For the past 2 years, I felt like I was alone when I was on stage as the lead singer but now, I am part of the whole ensemble. This is truly an experience that I will cherish.

> As a newly appointed CCA leader, I have learned many new things throughout the year. My experience has been exciting yet challenging at the same time, but I am glad as I have made many new memories with my CCA mates so far. These memories include changing from Dikir Barat to Angklung in such a short period of time, going through the difficulty of stage performances and trying my best to give hope to the other members to keep on going no matter how hard it gets. Although it has been difficult trying to cope with learning new skills, it has been an enjoyable journey for me because of the members who have given me great strength in continuing and motivating me during this time and have truly helped grow my confidence in so many ways. I really thank the seniors as well as they had made these two years such a fun experience not only for me but the other members as well and created joy during our struggles. This experience has truly made me reflect on myself and how I cope with the challenges as I am extremely thankful for this. My CCA members have made a smile on my face throughout the challenges that we faced, and I am shocked at how far we have gone. Not only am I grateful to have this opportunity but to also grow along with my CCA members and encourage them to keep going along this wonderful journey with me.
