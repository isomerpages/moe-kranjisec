<h3>Kranji Angklung &amp; Kulintang Ensemble (KAKE)</h3>
<p>The <strong>Kranji Angklung &amp; Kulintang Ensemble (KAKE)</strong>, previously
the Malay Culture and Language Society (MCLS), continues its transformative
evolution from a Clubs &amp; Society CCA to a Performing Arts one. Shifting
its focus from dikir barat and now focusing solely on performing as a musical
ensemble, KAKE takes on this new challenge to excel and be worthy!</p>

<p>Though relatively new and still finding its rhythm and groove, KAKE has
already managed to mesmerize many with its captivating fusion of tradition
and energy, through both school and public performances. KAKE has had the
privilege of performing at the school’s annual Hari Raya Concert, Passion
Arts Festival @ Limbang, Kranji Performing Arts Combined Concert Magical
Symphony &amp; Limbang National Day Carnival. The Ensemble has also been
fortunate to be involved in collaborative and outreach efforts with Darul
Ihsan Orphanage and Jurongville Secondary School.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving forward, the Kranji Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble stands eager
and ever ready to captivate even more audiences with its music that blends
rich cultural heritage with hints of modern creativity.</p>
