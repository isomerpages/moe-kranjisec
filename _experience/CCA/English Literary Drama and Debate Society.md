<h3>English Literary Drama and Debate Society</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>ELDDS</strong>&nbsp;is a vibrant and dynamic club with
confident and fun-loving members who are articulate in expressing their
emotions and feelings. The CCA has two main wings: Debate and Drama.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members in debate have the opportunity to receive training, to teach them
how to develop persuasive arguments. Members take part in the Singapore
Secondary Schools Debating Championships as well as informal sparring sessions
with debaters from other schools. Debaters develop their cognitive and
persuasive skills through these sessions, which also teach them how to
present ideas convincingly.</p>

<p>Drama members are provided with a well-rounded experience of theatre.
Students are exposed to a vast array of theatre skills such as voice projection,
articulation, scripting, stage managing and lighting design. Members also
have opportunities to watch performances for wider exposure about the craft.
ELDDS has attained excellent results at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts
Presentation over the years and taken part in performances at regional
libraries and Values In Action programmes organised within the community.</p>
