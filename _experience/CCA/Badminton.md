### Badminton

**Badminton** is one of the popular sports in Kranji Secondary School. It usually attracts a good number of students to join this sport. In this CCA, students go through an in-house development programme where they learn fundamental technical skills in the beginning and gradually progress to in-depth in acquiring these skills. The players also participate in the annual zonal competitions where they will exhibit sportmanships, perseverance and resilience in them during the games. In 2021, our B division Boys entered Top 8 in the National School Games West Zone Championship. Besides, students are given platforms to unleash their potential to lead, plan, organize and interact through activities like CCA camp. Ultimately, this sport promotes to instill in the players the ‘joy of learning’ and ‘learning for life’ spirit in their 4 to 5 years in this CCA.
