In the Badminton CCA, students learn fundamental technical skills in badminton and gradually progress to higher levels. The players get to participate in the annual National School Games competition where they would exhibit sportsmanship, perseverance, and resilience during the games. In addition, students are given numerous opportunities to lead, plan, organize and interact through activities like Secondary 1 Orientation, CCA bonding camp and Graduation farewell party. The CCA also encourages students to care and look out for each other, which evokes a sense of team spirit and togetherness.

**Students’ reflections:**

> When I stepped into this CCA as a Secondary 1 student, almost everything was new to me, and it was challenging for me to adapt to the environment. However, my teammates and the teachers were very welcoming and supportive, helping me to come out of my shell. Badminton CCA really provides countless opportunities for us to grow as individuals and as a team too. Events such as National School Games and friendly matches allowed us to learn the value of respect and teamwork, which is not something we can easily learn from textbooks. Badminton CCA has also helped me to hone both my social and leadership skills, which played a part in building my self-confidence. Overall, I definitely cherish the time I have in this CCA, and it’s safe to say that I have no regrets choosing Badminton!

> I had no experience in badminton when I joined in Secondary One, thus, I had a hard time training my stamina and skills with the help of my coach. Then, I was given the opportunity to take up a leadership role. This has encouraged me to build up my confidence and leadership skills. Coach always emphasised two important characteristics - attitude and discipline. These characteristics allowed the players to develop outstanding personalities. Although the training process is tough, what we badminton players know is that we should have perseverance in everything we do and no matter what, we will put in 120% of our effort.
