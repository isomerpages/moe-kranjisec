<p>In the Badminton CCA, students learn fundamental technical skills in badminton
and gradually progress to higher levels. The players get to participate
in the annual National School Games competition where they would exhibit
sportsmanship, perseverance, and resilience during the games. In addition,
students are given numerous opportunities to lead, plan, organize and interact
through activities like Secondary 1 Orientation, DSA selection trials,
CCA bonding camp and Graduation farewell party. The CCA also encourages
students to care and look out for each other, which evokes a sense of team
spirit and togetherness.</p>
<p><strong>Studentsâ€™ reflections:</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rejoicing in victories and mourning in times of despondency, that is the
quality of a good team. Since joining the badminton CCA, I have been exposed
to the benevolence of my teammates and teachers which has allowed our CCA
to be more bonded together. Throughout my journey, I have gained a deeper
understanding of my strengths and weaknesses as both a captain and a player.
However, as long as I have my teammates and teachers by my side, we will
be able to overcome any obstacle no matter what as one CCA!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I first embarked on my journey in badminton CCA, it was nerve wrecking
yet an eye opening experience. As a Secondary 1 student without any badminton
background, I felt out of place in this CCA. However, with the support
of my peers, teachers and coaches, I managed to overcome these challenges.
In addition, badminton CCA also provided me with countless opportunities
such as participating in national school games, friendly matches and even
leadership roles. Through these experiences, I grew both as a player and
as a person. All in all, my time in badminton CCA has fostered personal
growth, built lasting friendships, and deepened my passion for the sport,
encouraging me to strive for continuous improvement.</p>
