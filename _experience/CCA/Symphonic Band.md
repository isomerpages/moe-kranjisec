<p>The Kranji Concert Band visions itself as a dynamic team of music producers
and aims to nurture and develop students' musical talents to their fullest
potential with commitment and self-discipline. Formed in 1996, the Kranji
Concert Band has grown in strength and ability over the years, attaining
commendable results at the Singapore Youth Festival Central Arts Presentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since its first public concert on 17th June 2006 at ACS (Barker Road),
the Kranji Concert Band has successfully put up public performances at
Victoria Concert Hall, Republic Polytechnic, Singapore Conference Hall,
Marina Bay Sands Arts and Science Museum, Merlion Park @ One Fullerton
and The Singapore Flyer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With abundant performance and leadership opportunities within Kranji Concert
Band, students are able to develop themselves holistically apart from music
reading and instrumental skills acquisition. There is great emphasis on
discipline and character development, as well as an understanding of the
role and impact of each player on the whole team in music playing. The
alumni players return frequently to help out and show support for the Band,
and the dedicated team of teachers continually seeks out platforms for
the Band to further improve and excel in their performance quality.</p>
