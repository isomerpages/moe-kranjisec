### Kranji Concert Band

The **Kranji Concert Band** was formed in 1996, and has grown in strength and ability over the years, attaining commendable results at the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging and Arts Presentation. With its first public concert on 17th June 2006 at ACS (Barker Road), Kranji Symphonic Band has since then successfully completed four more public concerts at Victoria Concert Hall in 2008 and 2010, Republic Polytechnic in 2012 and Singapore Conference Hall in 2018. The Band has also performed at Marina Bay Sands Arts and Science Museum, Merlion Park @ One Fullerton and The Singapore Flyer. In 2012, the band took part in an international competition at Genting, Malaysia and clinched the Gold with Honours award.

With abundant performance and leadership opportunities within Kranji Concert Band, students are able to develop themselves holistically apart from music reading and instrumental skills acquisition. There is great emphasis on discipline and character development, as well as an understanding of the role and impact of each player on the whole team in music playing. The alumni players return frequently to help out and show support for the Band, and the dedicated team of teachers continually seeks out platforms for the Band to further improve and excel in their performance quality.
