### Kranji Choir

Since its official inception in 2000, **Kranji Choir** has grown in strength and ability, with consistently good performance at the Singapore Youth Festival over the years. With its vision ‘Lift Every Voice, Sing and Rejoice’, Kranji Choir has performed on multiple platforms, both internally at school events and externally at various public events, such as at Limbang Mid-Autumn Festival celebration, Limbang National Day Dinner and _A Little Singing Festival_ at School of the Arts (SOTA).

In the recent years, Kranji Choir has also participated in the annual _President’s Challenge Charity Choral Festival_ as part of its VIA programme, with some of the senior singers performing as members of The Grand Choir. In pursuit of excellence and exposure for all choir members, Kranji Choir will continue to explore opportunities to develop and showcase the talents of their members.

The past year has been challenging for all, but the Choir focused on the opportunities provided to sing together in e-performances, blending in individual voices and videos into one harmonious piece for key events such as the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day. The Choir also took part in the 2021 Singapore Youth Festival, where audio recordings were professionally captured, with praise by the adjudicators.
