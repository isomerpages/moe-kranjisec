<p>The Saint John Brigade (SJB) strives to develop a strong sense of social
awareness and participation, discipline and responsibility among all its
cadets through activities which enhance their emergency preparedness and
community involvement responsiveness. The different activities throughout
the year, both in school, SJB Headquarters and the community allow cadets
to be exposed to a diverse range of essential skills and knowledge such
as the First Aid, Home Nursing, Accident Prevention, Foot Drills and Leadership
skills.</p>

<p>One of the milestone activities that our cadets participate in yearly
is the National First Aid Competition (NFAC). The NFAC is an annual competition
organised by SJB Headquarters, where students compete against other schools
to demonstrate their mastery of their first aid, home nursing and foot
drill skills.</p>
