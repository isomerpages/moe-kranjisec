<p>The Saint John Brigade (SJB) strives to develop a strong sense of social
awareness and participation, discipline and responsibility among all its
cadets through activities which enhance their emergency preparedness and
community involvement responsiveness. The different activities throughout
the year, both in school, SJB Headquarters and the community allow cadets
to be exposed to a diverse range of essential skills and knowledge such
as the First Aid, Home Nursing, Accident Prevention, Foot Drills and Leadership
skills.</p>
