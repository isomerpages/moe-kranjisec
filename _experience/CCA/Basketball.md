### Basketball

Kranji Basketball aims to inculcate integrity, resilience and responsibility in each member. Our players strive for excellence during the National School Games (NSG) Basketball Zonal Championships in order to progress on to the next stage. In 2022, our players experienced the fruits of their labour, where the C Division boys advanced to the second round, and the B Division girls came in 2nd runner up in the Zonal competitions.
