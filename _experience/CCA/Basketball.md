**Kranji Basketball** aims to inculcate integrity, resilience and responsibility in each member. Our players strive for excellence during the National School Games (NSG) Basketball Zonal Championships in order to progress on to the next stage. In 2022, our players experienced the fruits of their labour, where the C Division boys advanced to the second round, and the B Division girls came in 2nd runner up in the Zonal competitions.

Players encourage one another towards the collective goal of giving their best effort during training and in competition. They train diligently and with passion as they hone their craft, and in the process build camaraderie and team spirit. We also organise friendly matches with other schools to learn from one other and develop skills as one basketball community.

> When I attended my first training session in Secondary 1, I was nervous. New school, new people, new environment. I did not know what to expect. Fast forward to 2022, my team has become my second family. My welcoming teammates, coach and teachers have made training very enjoyable and is something I look forward to at the end of a school day. This year we’ve achieved 3rd place for the B division National School Games (NSG) and this motivates us further to achieve greater heights in the next competition. I’m grateful and honoured to be a part of this Kranji Basketball family!
