<p>Kranji Basketball CCA fosters integrity, resilience, and responsibility
in every member, with the shared goal of giving their best in both training
and competitions. While achievements often measure a team's success, we
affirm that the true essence lies in the pursuit of excellence, the resilience
to never give up, and the strong camaraderie built along the way. This
year, our teams fought hard in the National School Games (NSG) and various
tournaments, showing remarkable grit and unity. Each game was an opportunity
to grow, both as individuals and as a team. Kranji Basketball remains committed
to working together and looks forward to achieving even greater success
in 2025. Keep striving for excellence!</p>

<p><strong><u>Reflection 1</u></strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a member of the Kranji Girls’ Basketball team, we celebrated both our
victories and our losses together. Though we faced setbacks, I am deeply
grateful for the time we spent united as one team, always showing our fighting
spirit even in difficult moments. This has inspired me to be the best teammate
and captain I can be, striving to lead our team toward even greater accomplishments.
My experience with the team is something I will cherish long after my time
at Kranji. I am incredibly proud to be the captain of the Kranji Girls’
Basketball team.</p>

<br><strong><u>Reflection 2</u></strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the captain of the Kranji Boys' Basketball Team, I am incredibly proud
of our team through both our wins and losses. Even when we don’t achieve
the outcome we hope for, we still hustle for every ball and fight for every
possession. I’m grateful for the people in this team; despite the highs
and lows we’ve faced, one thing has never changed—our unity as a team.
Every time we step onto the court, we give our best, not just for ourselves
but for each other, whether it’s helping a teammate up when they’re down
or cheering from the bench. Each of us brings something unique to the court.
We all have individual skills, but it’s our teamwork—through hours of practice
and intense games, leaving it all on the floor—that truly sets us apart.
Every player on this team has shown resilience and dedication, and for
that, I am deeply thankful.</p>
