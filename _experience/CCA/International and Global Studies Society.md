<p>Designed to cultivate students’ interest and engage them in societal and
global issues, the International and Global Studies (CCA) exposes students
to interdisciplinary learning experiences beyond the classroom. The wide
array of activities are designed to allow students to cultivate global
perspectives and personal effectiveness dispositions. A global perspective
gives our students the skills to solve problems, think critically, and
find ways to build collaboration at the local and global level.</p>

<p>Students participating in National Junior College (NJC) International
Humanities Symposium 2023.</p>
<p>Two teams from IGS club participated in the National Junior College (NJC)
International Humanities Symposium 2023. The symposium is an annual event
that provides a platform for local and international students to showcase
their humanities research projects, share insights gleaned from their research
with a like-minded community, and build friendships that seed opportunities
for future collaborations.</p>
<p>One of the KSS teams, led by Destinee Joy Boey Kit Ann and comprising
Ang Jing Yuan Fiona, Chia Joon Hee, Lim En Ning Clarissa, and Toh Xin Hui,
won the Best Research Award (Gold) for their project titled “The Influence
of Geopolitics on the Rise of our ‘Little Red Dot’”.</p>
<p>The team’s victory is a testament to their hard work and dedication. They
spent months researching their topic, and they worked tirelessly to prepare
for their presentation. Their project was well-received by the judges and
other schools’ participants, who praised the team’s research and their
presentation skills.</p>
