### International and Global Studies

Designed to cultivate students’ interest and engage them in the societal and global issues, the&nbsp;**International and Global Studies (CCA)**&nbsp;exposes students to interdisciplinary learning experiences beyond the classroom. The wide array of activities allow students to cultivate global perspectives.&nbsp;A global&nbsp;perspective gives our students the skills to solve problems, think critically, and find ways to build&nbsp;collaboration at a local and global level.

Through their 4 years&nbsp;of active participation in the CCA, students are able to:  

*   deepen their understanding of the society and global community;
*   nurture into critical thinkers and responsible global citizens; and
*   develop their leadership and personal capabilities.

Students hone their skills and knowledge through various activities such as learning journeys, popular films critique, map making and participation in local and overseas competitions and conferences. As leaders of Humanities-related events, students have opportunities to lead in school-wide events such as the annual Humanities Amazing Race Programme (HARP), Humanities Week etc. which will enable them to apply and showcase their learning and leadership competencies.

Two teams from IGS club participated in the National Junior College (NJC) International Humanities Symposium 2023. The symposium is an annual event that provides a platform for local and international students to showcase their humanities research projects, share insights gleaned from their research with a like-minded community, and build friendships that seed opportunities for future collaborations.

One of the KSS teams, led by Destinee Joy Boey Kit Ann and comprising Ang Jing Yuan Fiona, Chia Joon Hee, Lim En Ning Clarissa, and Toh Xin Hui, won the Best Research Award (Gold) for their project titled “The Influence of Geopolitics on the Rise of our ‘Little Red Dot’”.

The team’s victory is a testament to their hard work and dedication. They spent months researching their topic, and they worked tirelessly to prepare for their presentation. Their project was well-received by the judges and other schools’ participants, who praised the team’s research and their presentation skills.

The other team, led by Arhan Chakraborty and comprising Beverly Low, Norman Tay, Ni Lang, and Tan Ying Bei, also presented their project at the symposium. Their project, titled “Social Media is the New Weapon in Modern Warfare”, was well-received by the judging panel.

In 2023, the students honed their organisational and interpersonal skills and knowledge through various activities. For instance, they learnt about WWII and its impacts on Singapore through designing and implementing their own Heritage Trail at Upper Bukit Timah.
