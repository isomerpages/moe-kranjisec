<p>Designed to cultivate students’ interest and engage them in societal and
global issues, the International and Global Studies (CCA) exposes students
to interdisciplinary learning experiences beyond the classroom. The wide
array of activities are designed to allow students to cultivate global
perspectives and personal effectiveness dispositions. A global perspective
gives our students the skills to solve problems, think critically, and
find ways to build collaboration at the local and global level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through their 4 years&nbsp;of active participation in the CCA, students
are able to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>deepen their understanding of the society and global community;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nurture into critical thinkers and responsible global citizens; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop their leadership and personal capabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students hone their skills and knowledge through various activities such
as learning journeys, popular films critique, map making and participation
in local and overseas competitions and conferences. As leaders of Humanities-related
events, students have opportunities to lead in school-wide events such
as the annual Humanities Amazing Race Programme (HARP), Humanities Week
etc. which will enable them to apply and showcase their learning and leadership
competencies.</p>

<p>Students participating in National Junior College (NJC) International
Humanities Symposium 2023.</p>
<p>Two teams from IGS club participated in the National Junior College (NJC)
International Humanities Symposium 2023. The symposium is an annual event
that provides a platform for local and international students to showcase
their humanities research projects, share insights gleaned from their research
with a like-minded community, and build friendships that seed opportunities
for future collaborations.</p>
<p>One of the KSS teams, led by Destinee Joy Boey Kit Ann and comprising
Ang Jing Yuan Fiona, Chia Joon Hee, Lim En Ning Clarissa, and Toh Xin Hui,
won the Best Research Award (Gold) for their project titled “The Influence
of Geopolitics on the Rise of our ‘Little Red Dot’”.</p>
<p>The team’s victory is a testament to their hard work and dedication. They
spent months researching their topic, and they worked tirelessly to prepare
for their presentation. Their project was well-received by the judges and
other schools’ participants, who praised the team’s research and their
presentation skills.</p>
<p>The other team, led by Arhan Chakraborty and comprising Beverly Low, Norman
Tay, Ni Lang, and Tan Ying Bei, also presented their project at the symposium.
Their project, titled “Social Media is the New Weapon in Modern Warfare”,
was well-received by the judging panel.</p>
