### Device Management Application

A Device Management Application (DMA) will come pre-installed on all PLDs purchased through the school and will be installed on all student-owned devices subject to parental/guardian consent. The Mobile Device Management Service facilitates the updating and managing of the PLD, protects the PLD from malicious software and protects students from objectionable internet content. The Usage Management Service enables the school and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after school.
