<p>Please refer to the student handbook for more details.</p>
<h3>Our Objective</h3>
<p>The Code of Conduct outlines the personal conduct and disciplinary standards
expected of all Kranjians.</p>
<h3>Our Approach to Discipline</h3>
<p>Our approach to discipline guides and encourages every Kranjian to become
self-reflective and self-disciplined. &nbsp;Effective discipline is grounded
in a consistent philosophy, which the school promotes through opportunities
for reflection and circle time.</p>
<h3>School Values</h3>
<p>Our aim is to instil the School Values – Respect, Responsibility, Resilience,
Compassion, Integrity and Passion for Learning (R³CIP), focusing on the
following philosophy for fostering good discipline:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The goal of discipline is to teach self-regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discipline is a learning process that develops students' thinking and
moral compass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A whole-school, multi-faceted approach is essential.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Restorative Practices and Relational Circles</h3>
<p>A key strategy for fostering good discipline is to enhance our students’
Social and Emotional (SEL) Competencies by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Creating a supportive and structural environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching values, and social and emotional skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing opportunities for students to demonstrate positive behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guiding and re-orientating students through restorative practices for
those who have erred in their behaviours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Engagement with Stakeholders</h3>
<p>Consistent collaboration with stakeholders is essential for effective
discipline. This includes partnerships with parents/guardians and external
agencies to help our students become self-disciplined individuals of good
character and uphold the School Values.</p>
<h3>General Conduct</h3>
<p>Students are expected to uphold the School Values at all times.</p>
<h3>Flag Raising Ceremony</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students must report to their respective assembly venues by 8am each morning
for the flag-raising ceremony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon arrival, students should begin their prescribed reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Students who are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem and take the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with the right fist over the heart.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school song will be sung on Mondays.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Attendance, Punctuality and Leaving School</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Attending school is compulsory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students must be punctual and will be considered late if not present at
the assembly venue.</p>

<h4>Offences Related to Vaping</h4>
<p>Students caught for vaping offences related to vaping, possession of vape
or its peripherals and selling of vapes will be subjected to both the national
penalties and school-based consequences.</p>
<p>The school-based disciplinary actions will be meted out in addition to
the national penalties imposed by HSA. This applies to students who were
caught offending in school and outside of school.</p>
<p>Students caught selling and trafficking of e-vaporisers may be considered
for additional school-based consequences, including expulsion (for secondary
schools and JCs/MI).</p>
