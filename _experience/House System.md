<p>Since the start of the school in 1995, the <strong>Kranji House system</strong> was
created to foster team spirit, a sense of loyalty and belonging in students
and teachers in the house and to the school at large. This is done via
friendly competition and numerous House-related activities. Students and
teachers contribute points to their own Houses. At the end of the year,
the House with the most number of points will be crowned the Overall Champion
House!</p>

<p>The six Houses of Kranji Secondary School. The first letter of each House
spells the name K.R.A.N.J.I !</p>
<p>With the implementation of Full Subject Based-Banding (FSBB) in 2022,
the school leveraged on the existing House system to class the Secondary
1 into their classes. Hence from 2022 onwards, all new Sec 1 students will
be allocated to their House which would also be their class. For example
in Class 1K, all the students in that class will be in Kestrel House and
would don their signature yellow t-shirt; Class 1R will all be in Rhino
House and would don their bright red t-shirt!</p>

<p>Let’s find out more about the six different Houses!</p>
<h3>KESTREL</h3>
<p>As we rise above the rest, we leave a trail. A trail that you tail. Follow
our trail, don’t be frail. Follow our trail, rest assured, you won’t fail.</p>
<p>Motto: “<strong>RISE ABOVE THE REST</strong>”</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Kestrel%20flag.png">
</div>
<p>Our rings, you will hear.</p>
<p>Hearts race as we chant our cheers.</p>
<p>Our message is clear.</p>
<p>Klee-Klee-Klee we ring.</p>
<p>A good fight to the table,</p>
<p>We, for sure, will bring.</p>
<p>Mini mighty spunk</p>
<p>Borrowed from Falcons, you’d think.</p>
<p>Our spirit’s distinct.</p>
<p>Brace yourself, you’ll hear.</p>
<p>Come join us, the flight is near.</p>
<p>Kestrel, We don’t fear</p>
<h3>RHINO</h3>
<p>Rhinoceros are powerful creatures. They can weigh up to 8000 pounds, but
can still run up to 40 miles per hour despite their immense weight. Though
it is a peaceful animal, it has a reputation for being dangerous when threatened.
A charging rhino embodies power and might.</p>
<p>Motto:&nbsp; "<strong>CHARGE TO GLORY</strong>"</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Rhino%20flag.png">
</div>
<p>Just like the Rhinoceros which has thick, layered skin to protect themselves
from external harm, our Rhinos are resilient and are able to persevere
through challenges. This can be either through sportsmanship on the annual
Sports Day, Sports Fiesta and Inter-House Games, or through intellect and
wits during Humanities Amazing Race and other non-sports events. We are
also proud to announce that the Rhino House won the Overall House Champion
in 2015!</p>
<p>Who are we? We are the Rhinos! Join our RhinOhana and together, we will
Charge to Glory!</p>
<h3>ALBATROSS</h3>
<p>Made famous in a poem, the albatross shall live up to its reputation as
the troublesome burden – to others! With its tremendous wingspan, sometimes
exceeding 3.7 metres, the massive albatross will easily impress by sheer
size and unsurpassed gliding power. Known also for its stamina and endurance
in long distance travelling, the albatross is ever ready to go “<strong>BEYOND THE LIMITS</strong>”</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Alba%20flag.png">
</div>
<p>An Albatross aloft is a spectacular sight! Made famous in a poem, the
Albatross lives up to its reputation as the troublesome burden – to outsiders!
With its formidable wingspans, sometimes exceeding 3.7 metres, the impressive
Albatross will easily ride the ocean winds and sometimes glide for hours
without rest or even a flap of its wings. This is how we are as the Albatross
House. We are truly resilient and we don’t give up when the going gets
tough. We continue to fight on no matter what the outcome is.</p>
<p>Young Albatrosses may fly within three to ten months after they are hatched,
this shows that Albatross House members are fast-learners and we adapt
very quickly depending on the situation. We learn from mistakes and pick
up new skills and knowledge along the way so that we can anticipate and
overcome future challenges.</p>
<p>The Albatross impresses not just by sheer size but by its unsurpassed
gliding power. We are known for our stamina and endurance in long distance
travelling. We soar high to catch and ride the wind. The Albatross is ever
ready to go beyond the limits.</p>
<h3>NIGHTHAWK</h3>
<p>Smaller than the hawk but no less majestic and daring with its characteristic
wide wingspread, the nighthawk is more enduring in energy and stamina and
stays in flight longer at greater heights. The motto "<strong>WITH WINGS WE FLY, WITH GUTS WE TRY</strong>"
has thus been inspired by the courage and perseverance of this creature.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Nighthawk%20flag.png">
</div>
<p>Like the nighthawk, Kranjians who belong to the Nighthawk house are always
encouraged to go beyond their limits and not be afraid of failures. No
matter the outcome, Nighthawk members are always willing to try and participate
in various house-based activities. Achieving victory is never a primary
goal; learning from failures and enjoying the process are always emphasised
instead!</p>
<p>In Nighthawk, bonding and camaraderie are emphasised as well. Games and
initiation ceremonies are planned during the Secondary One Orientation
to welcome them into the Nighthawk family. Besides the various planned
house events and activities, bonding games are regularly held during house
meetings to encourage interaction across classes and levels among house
members.</p>
<p>Nighthawk members thus go through their journey in the house together
as one family, with an open mind and a ‘never-say-die’ attitude!</p>
<h3>JAGUAR</h3>
<p>The jaguar epitomises excellence in speed and was particularly chosen
for its excellent ability to run and even swim, proving it to be an extremely
powerful animal. It possesses a strong survival instinct. It is fearless
and is feared and revered by all.</p>
<p>Motto: &nbsp;"<strong>FEARSOME AND FEARLESS – READY TO STRIKE!</strong>"</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Jaguar%20flag.png">
</div>
<p>True to our motto, members of Jaguar house are fearsome and fearless,
and are ready to take on any challenge that comes our way. Not only do
we have athletes who give their all in sporting events like Sports Day
and Inter-house Games, we also excel in events requiring mass participation
such as the National Day Fiesta, Total Defence Day Carnival and Cheering
competition during Sports Day.</p>
<p>Being the overall house champion for five consecutive years from 2016
to 2022 is no mean feat! Jaguar house prides itself for our high level
of teamwork. We work together towards our common goal, with every single
member earning as many points as they can to contribute to the overall
house scores.</p>
<p>Wherever your strength lies, there will be a place for you in Jaguar house,
as long as you are ever ready to strike!</p>
<h3>Ibex</h3>
<p>When it comes to nimbleness and surefootedness, others pale into insignificance.
Steadfast and determined, the ibex is known for its agility in leaping
about ledges and rugged terrain. Ibex will go where lesser creatures fear
to tread.</p>
<p>Motto: "<strong>Stronger together, better than ever</strong>"</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Ibex%20flag.png">
</div>
<p>ike the sure-footed and agile Ibex that inhabit the rugged mountains and
cliffs, Kranjians who belong to Ibex remain undaunted in the face of difficulties
and are able to find their way out of challenging situations. Ibex live
in herds and depend on each other for survival. Similarly, Ibex house members
exhibit camaraderie and work closely together during school events.</p>
<p>New Ibex house members will meet their fellow housemates during Secondary
One Orientation. The Ibex House Committee usually plans some fun ice-breakers
so the juniors get to know their Ibex seniors. During the annual Sports
Day, all Ibex members have a chance to participate in the events by signing
up either in teams or individually. Even if one is not inclined towards
sports, one can contribute by helping to make props for the cheerleading
competition, or even volunteer as a cheerleader! There is a myriad of other
school events, such as the Humanities Amazing Race, the annual Inter-House
Games and the Sports Fiesta, where Ibex members can proudly represent their
house and earn points to bring Ibex closer to clinching the House Championship.</p>
<p>Through all these exciting events, an Ibex member will truly understand
that we are stronger together, and when we come together as one house and
work with each other, we will be better than ever.</p>
