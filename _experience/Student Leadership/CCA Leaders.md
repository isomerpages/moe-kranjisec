### CCA Leaders

CCA Leaders have a burning passion for their CCAs and possess a zeal to ensure that&nbsp;their CCA excel. They are trained to evaluate their CCAs and work towards enhancing the CCA experiences and outcomes of their CCA. They also learn to lead their CCAs in debrief to enhance learning of their CCA peers. They have a strong sense of responsibility towards their CCA and a&nbsp;deep attachment to their seniors, juniors and peers.&nbsp;

Within the school, CCA Leaders are&nbsp;acknowledged as significant student leaders who contribute to school events and good role models. Collectively, they also come&nbsp;together to do inter-CCA collaboration to serve the school by planning for programmes on a school level.
