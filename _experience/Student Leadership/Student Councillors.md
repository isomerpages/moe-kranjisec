### Student Councillors

The Student Council serves the student body and strives to represent them in matters relating to school improvement and student welfare. Student Councillors organise key school events which promote a strong school spirit such as Secondary One Orientation Programme, Teachers’ and Executive Administrative Staff (EAS) Appreciation Day, Graduation Day and Well Wishes, and Leaders’ Day. They also actively serve the community by participating in meaningful community service events such as Mid-Autumn Festival for the Limbang community and the Leadership Challenge Workshop for Primary School Leaders. The Student Council also serves as a liaison between students and staff and provide suggestions to school management for school improvements.
