### Student Councillors

The Student Council serves the student body and strives to represent them in matters relating to school improvement and student welfare. This year, the Student Council organised key school events like the Secondary One Orientation and brought back the physical version of the Teachers’ and Executive Administrative Staff (EAS) Day Celebrations and Leaders’ Day. They also actively serve the community by participating in meaningful community service events such as Voices of Youth and Mid-Autumn Festival for the Limbang community, and the Leadership Challenge Workshop for the cluster’s Primary School Leaders. They planned and executed the self-initiated Values-In-Action (VIA) projects by establishing new partnerships with Orange Valley Senior Activity Centre.

The Student Council also serves as a liaison between students and staff, and provides suggestions to school management for school improvements. They also identify areas of needs within the school and implement ad-hoc school improvement projects.
