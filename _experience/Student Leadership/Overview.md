### Student Leadership Development

Kranji Secondary School believes that every student has the potential to be a leader and aspires to Nurture a Leader in every Kranjian. Every Kranjian is encouraged to develop their leadership capabilities through exposure to the mindset that leadership can be learned.

The Schoolâ€™s Leadership structure aims to allow every Kranjian an opportunity to develop their leadership capabilities, whether in formal positions or not. Leadership training and opportunities through the various Student Leadership roles are offered to students who aspire to develop their leadership skills and competencies. Although each student leadership role has its own function, they share a common purpose to serve the School and the community.
