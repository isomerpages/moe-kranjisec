Since the start of the school in 1995, the **Kranji House system** was created to foster team spirit, a sense of loyalty and belonging in students and teachers in the house and to the school at large. This is done via friendly competition and numerous House-related activities. Students and teachers contribute points to their own Houses. At the end of the year, the House with the most number of points will be crowned the Overall Champion House!

With the implementation of Full Subject Based-Banding (FSBB) in 2022, the school leveraged on the existing House system to class the Secondary 1 into their classes. Hence from 2022 onwards, all new Sec 1 students will be allocated to their House which would also be their class. For example in Class 1K, all the students in that class will be in Kestrel House and would don their signature yellow t-shirt; Class 1R will all be in Rhino House and would don their bright red t-shirt!

The 6 Houses are based on the letters of the school name: K R A N J I. Each House is represented by an animal mascot and its House colour.

Let’s find out more about the six different Houses!

### KESTREL

As we rise above the rest, we leave a trail. A trail that you tail. Follow our trail, don’t be frail. Follow our trail, rest assured, you won’t fail.

Motto: “**RISE ABOVE THE REST**”

     style="width:60%">

Our rings, you will hear.

Hearts race as we chant our cheers.

Our message is clear.
	
Klee-Klee-Klee we ring.

A good fight to the table,

We, for sure, will bring.

Mini mighty spunk

Borrowed from Falcons, you’d think.

Our spirit’s distinct.

Brace yourself, you’ll hear.

Come join us, the flight is near.

Kestrel, We don’t fear

### RHINO

Rhinoceros are powerful creatures. They can weigh up to 8000 pounds, but can still run up to 40 miles per hour despite their immense weight. Though it is a peaceful animal, it has a reputation for being dangerous when threatened. A charging rhino embodies power and might.

Motto:  "**CHARGE TO GLORY**"

<img src="/images/Rhino%20flag.png" 
     style="width:60%">

Just like the Rhinoceros which has thick, layered skin to protect themselves from external harm, our Rhinos are resilient and are able to persevere through challenges. This can be either through sportsmanship on the annual Sports Day, Sports Fiesta and Inter-House Games, or through intellect and wits during Humanities Amazing Race and other non-sports events. We are also proud to announce that the Rhino House won the Overall House Champion in 2015!

Who are we? We are the Rhinos! Join our RhinOhana and together, we will Charge to Glory!

### ALBATROSS

Made famous in a poem, the albatross shall live up to its reputation as the troublesome burden – to others! With its tremendous wingspan, sometimes exceeding 3.7 metres, the massive albatross will easily impress by sheer size and unsurpassed gliding power. Known also for its stamina and endurance in long distance travelling, the albatross is ever ready to go “**BEYOND THE LIMITS**”

An Albatross aloft is a spectacular sight! Made famous in a poem, the Albatross lives up to its reputation as the troublesome burden – to outsiders! With its formidable wingspans, sometimes exceeding 3.7 metres, the impressive Albatross will easily ride the ocean winds and sometimes glide for hours without rest or even a flap of its wings. This is how we are as the Albatross House. We are truly resilient and we don’t give up when the going gets tough. We continue to fight on no matter what the outcome is.

Young Albatrosses may fly within three to ten months after they are hatched, this shows that Albatross House members are fast-learners and we adapt very quickly depending on the situation. We learn from mistakes and pick up new skills and knowledge along the way so that we can anticipate and overcome future challenges.

The Albatross impresses not just by sheer size but by its unsurpassed gliding power. We are known for our stamina and endurance in long distance travelling. We soar high to catch and ride the wind. The Albatross is ever ready to go beyond the limits.
