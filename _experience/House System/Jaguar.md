The jaguar epitomises excellence in speed and was particularly chosen for its excellent ability to run and even swim, proving it to be an extremely powerful animal. It possesses a strong survival instinct. It is fearless and is feared and revered by all.

Motto:  **"FEARSOME AND FEARLESS – READY TO STRIKE!"**

True to our motto, members of Jaguar house are fearsome and fearless, and are ready to take on any challenge that comes our way. Not only do we have athletes who give their all in sporting events like Sports Day and Inter-house Games, we also excel in events requiring mass participation such as the National Day Fiesta, Total Defence Day Carnival and Cheering competition during Sports Day.

Being the overall house champion for five consecutive years from 2016 to 2020 is no mean feat! Jaguar house prides itself for our high level of teamwork. We work together towards our common goal, with every single member earning as many points as they can to contribute to the overall house scores.

Wherever your strength lies, there will be a place for you in Jaguar house, as long as you are ever ready to strike!
