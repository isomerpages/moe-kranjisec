### Secondary One Posting

#### Secondary One Registration

A very warm welcome to Kranji Secondary School! Congratulations to your child/ward for his/her all-round performance in the primary school and thank you for making our school your preferred choice.  

  

We look forward to working closely with you as partners in education in developing your child/ward to his/her fullest potential and ensuring that he/she will have an enriching Kranji Experience with us.

  

**In light of the COVID-19 situation, we seek your understanding and patience that the Secondary 1 Registration process is to be completed online and electronically.  You are strongly advised to do online purchase/delivery of school uniform and textbooks.**

Only one parent may accompany the child to enter the school for purchases/collection.  For enhanced SMM, no parent is allowed to enter the school from 4 Jan 2022 onwards.  To facilitate contact tracing, visitors are required to carry their own **TraceTogether tokens** with them wherever they go, and not exchange their tokens with others.  If you or any of your household members are unwell or on High Risk Warning (HRW), please stay at home and make alternative arrangements for your purchases.
