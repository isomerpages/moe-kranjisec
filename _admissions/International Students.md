### International Students

International students who wish to seek admission to our mainstream schools at the Secondary 1 to 3 levels must take part in the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS).

  

This will help to ensure that international students admitted to our mainstream schools are able to cope with the requirements of the Singapore education and curriculum.

  

Admission is not guaranteed, and is subject to the applicant’s performance in the centralised test on English and Mathematics. If successful, placement will take into consideration the available vacancies and the applicant's declared Singapore residential area where possible.

  

International students with at least one parent who is a Singapore Citizen (SC) can click [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/international-students).
