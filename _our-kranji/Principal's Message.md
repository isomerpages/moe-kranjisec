Established in 1995, the school has grown from strength to strength to develop each student into a self-directed learner, a caring leader, and an active contributor to the community. Our caring and motivated team of teachers supports our students in living up to the school motto to find their own “Breakthrough” in their life journey.</p><p>Through the Kranji Experience, we prepare our students to be ready for the future. We equip them with the opportunities to be Creators, to have adaptive and inventive thinking, and to find innovative solutions for sustainable living. We also offer platforms to help them be Connectors to communicate and collaborate with peers and community partners in Singapore and beyond. This is so that every student can find a sense of purpose and be a Contributor to our society, with their unique gifts nurtured in school.</p><p>The Kranji Experience includes the curricular and co-curricular programmes, as well as our distinctive programmes such as the Applied Learning Programme, “Design Innovation for Sustainable Living”; Learning for Life Programme, “Community and Youth Leadership”; and Internationalisation programme. Our school also leverages Educational Technology (EdTech) to facilitate learning.</p><p>We will soon celebrate our 30th anniversary in 2025. As we begin a new chapter, we will continue to help each student find the joy of learning to nurture their disposition to learn for life. I invite you to explore this website to learn more about the Kranji Experience and the “Breakthroughs” our students achieved when they are with us.</p><p>We hope you will join us on this journey too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Chua Lek Hong<br>Principal<br>Kranji Secondary School</p>
