<p>It is a pleasure to serve as the Principal of this vibrant institution.
Established in 1995, Kranji Secondary School has continuously strengthened
its commitment to providing a positive and meaningful Kranji Experience
for every student. At the heart of our mission is the development of the
Kranjian Identity, where every student is nurtured to become a Thinker,
a Leader, and a Champion. We are dedicated to cultivating a caring and
enabling environment, grounded in our core values of Responsibility, Resilience,
Respect, Compassion, Integrity, and a Passion for Learning.</p>

<p>The Kranji Experience includes both curricular and co-curricular programmes,
as well as unique offerings like the Applied Learning Programme, "Design
Innovation for Sustainable Living," the Learning for Life Programme, "Community
and Youth Leadership," and our Internationalisation Programme. Our programmes
utilise a three-tiered approach: Core, Enrich, and Aspire. This structure
ensures that all students can participate in broad-based programmes while
those with specific talents or interests have opportunities for further
development.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Having recently celebrated our 30th anniversary, we embark on a new chapter
in Kranji’s journey. Anchored in our school motto, <strong>“Breakthrough,”</strong> we
commit to nurturing students who find joy in learning and develop a lifelong
disposition to learn, contribute, and lead. This spirit of breakthrough
is brought to life through our <strong>4G approach — Goal, Growth Mindset, Grit, and Gratitude</strong> —
which shapes how our students think, act, and learn each day. We believe
that meaningful growth begins with purposeful goals, is strengthened by
a growth mindset, sustained through perseverance, and anchored in gratitude.</p>
