### Industry Visits

The Industry Visits provide our Secondary 3 students with the opportunity to experience and gain a better understanding of industries they are interested in and how these organisations contribute to the high-growth economies in Singapore – the Digital, Care and Green Economies – through guided site visits and opportunities to dialogue with company staff and management. Through the Industry Visits, students explore potential career interests, allowing them to make more informed further education decisions. Examples of organisations that our students have visited in the past include Shangri-La Hotel, Boeing, McDonald’s, A*STAR, Pacific Light, Yishun Health and many more.

### Job Shadowing

Selected students who wish to extend their learning about the world of work further are given the opportunity to participate in job shadowing with partner organisations for a period of a few days. During the job shadowing, they are attached to a mentor who trains and guides them through their entire experience. Through these invaluable opportunities, our students develop critical life skills and work habits that prepare them for the future of work.
