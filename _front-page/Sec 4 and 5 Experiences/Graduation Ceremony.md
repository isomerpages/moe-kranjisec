<p>During the event, heartfelt messages from all their teachers are shared,

<p>As a rite of passage, our Principal, Vice-Principals and teachers present
students with the school collar pin onto the collar of the studentsâ€™ shirts,
signifying their graduation from the school; this is in contrast to their
first day in the school 4-5 years ago as Sec 1s, when their form teachers
presented them with tie-pins to welcome them as Kranjians.</p>
