<p>One of the ‘rites of passage’ for our graduating students, the Wellness
and Resilience Walk is an approximately 10 km hike for the Secondary 4
and 5 students before they embark on their National Examinations.</p>
<p>Besides being a great opportunity for class bonding and an avenue to manifest
the value of resilience, the Wellness and Resilience Walk will bring our
Kranjians along paths filled with nature and natural beauty. Through this
refreshing walk, we hope our students are re-energised and are more motivated
to maximise their effort to achieve the breakthrough in their results that
they desire.</p>
