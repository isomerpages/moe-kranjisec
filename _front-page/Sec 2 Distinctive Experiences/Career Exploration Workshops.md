Our Secondary 2 students make important decisions on the subject combination they will take when they progress to Upper Secondary. At Kranji Secondary School, we equip our students to make more informed decisions through our partnership with The Astronauts Collective, a registered charity in Singapore where volunteers from diverse education and career pathways work with youth to help them explore and discover meaningful careers.

  TAC runs a Career Exploration Workshop that includes (i) Job Tasters that provide our students with the opportunity to try out and experience different jobs, and how they contribute towards improving the world around them, as well as (ii) Career Human Libraries, where a diverse range of career professionals engage students in a dialogue on their education and career journeys.
