### Ethic Dance Programme

2019 marked the opportunity for Secondary 2 studentsâ€™ involvement in the post-examination Ethnic Dance programme. Over 4 days, they learnt dance techniques unique to the cultures of the four major ethnic groups in Singapore.

Outstanding classes displayed their dance moves during the school assembly programme. The classes raised to the occasion, making the atmosphere in the school hall an exhilarating and memorable one. It was a truly exception experience for our students.
