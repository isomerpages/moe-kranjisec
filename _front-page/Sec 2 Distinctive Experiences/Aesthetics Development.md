The Aesthetics Development programme aims to provide an avenue for our students to develop their interests and display their talents in the arts. Through a structured yet versatile programme, the students gain exposure to diverse art forms and are provided with platforms to stretch their talents.

**Sec 2 Dance Enrichment**

During the May post examination programme, as part of our school holistic education in Aesthetics and appreciation for the Arts, our secondary 2 cohort had a 10 hours dance enrichment programme. They were taught and learnt about dance techniques and routines unique on fusion dance of Malay, Chinese, India and Hip Hop/K Pop, making this a truly exceptional experience for our students.

There was a friendly dance competition at the end of the programme and it was a stiff competition as all 7 classes of Secondary 2 students put in their best. The 4th placing went to 2K2, 3rd placing went to 2K3 and 2K4, runner up went to 2K1 and the winner was 2R2. The atmosphere in the school hall was exhilarating during the performance and the dancers raised to the occasion and everyone enjoyed it.

**School Assembly Programme**

To allow our students to be exposed to other Art forms, a slew of good quality Art performances were staged. For this year, we have a Hari Raya celebration concert by Sri Warisan Performing Arts Ltd which was integrated with our school’s Malay Culture and Language CCA student performers.

We also had a A Capella singing performance by the A Capella Society Ltd. We aim to strengthen the arts appreciation and to provide quality Arts Education experience for all.
