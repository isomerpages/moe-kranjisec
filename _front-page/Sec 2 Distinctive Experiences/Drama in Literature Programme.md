The Literature Learning Journey has always been a key part of Kranji Secondary School’s Literature programme. After a 2-year hiatus due to Covid-19 restrictions, the Secondary Two cohort, armed with their mobile devices and the Literature Learning Journey package, ventured out into the Tiong Bahru neighbourhood and experienced poetry coming to life through a multi-sensory experience. 

During the Learning Journey, students are engaged in multimodal tasks that break away from the monotony of the usual pen-and-paper tasks. They explore their own neighbourhoods, visiting places like traditional coffee shops and children’s playgrounds etc. As they immerse in the multisensory experience offered by the surroundings, they take note of pertinent information, collect relevant artefacts and complete authentic tasks related to the poems in the poetry resource package.
