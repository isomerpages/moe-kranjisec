In a landscape of diverse study and work options, knowledge of trends in the industry sectors empowers students to make informed education and career choices in school and beyond graduation, as part of the national SkillsFuture movement. To this end, Kranji Secondary School organises an annual Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Fair for all students from the graduating cohort, to inspire them to be forward-thinking and adaptable for the future of work.

Representatives from post-secondary education institutions are invited to share more about the various post-secondary education pathways that are available, while industry partners, Parent Support Group (PSG) members and school alumni are invited to share their authentic insights on the ever-changing world of work, the job opportunities and challenges in their respective sectors, and the skillsets that employers are looking out for.

As part of the preparation for the ECG Fair, students are given time to explore our school’s [ECG website](https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/kssecg/home) in advance, where they learn about the economic growth areas in Singapore’s Future Economy, the critical core skills needed, as well as the various pathways available to them. They are also encouraged to come prepared with questions so that they will benefit more from their interactions with the various speakers.
