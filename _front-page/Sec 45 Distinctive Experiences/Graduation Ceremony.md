Graduation Day signifies the last official day of school for our Secondary 4 and 5 Kranjians, before they have a short study break as they gear up towards the start of their N-Levels and O-Levels examinations.

During the event, heartfelt messages from all their teachers are shared, reflecting their well-wishes and aspirations to our graduating cohort.

As a rite of passage, our Principal, Vice-Principals and teachers would pin the school collar pin onto the collar of the students’ shirts, signifying their graduation from the school; this is in contrast to their first day in the school 4-5 years ago as Sec 1 newbies, when their form teachers clip on the tie-pins to welcome them as Kranjians.

Quote from Darryl Ng Yuhui of class 4K3:

> Graduation Day was celebrated magnificently with a video montage to reminisce our journey in Kranji. The collar pin ceremony (a contrast to our tie clip ceremony during Sec 1 Inauguration), marked the end of our time in Kranji and gave us something to remember Kranji in the future. We got to give gifts to our friends and take many pictures to immortalise our friendship. It was a very fun day filled with cries and laughter and I’m glad to have graduated from Kranji and be a part of the Kranji Alumni!
