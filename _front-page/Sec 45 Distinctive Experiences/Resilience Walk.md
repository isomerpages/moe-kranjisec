### Resilience Walk

Embarking on an arduous yet enjoyable walk through a scenic park is indeed a novel and effective way to develop resilience. On 4 October 2019 after the Preliminary Examination, students from the graduating classes of Secondary 4 and 5 went on a nature walk at Punggol Park. Together with their class mentors, PE teachers and school leaders, the graduating class students spent a good four hours trekking through nature. The fine weather with clear skies and cool breeze was a blessing for all who were involved in the activity. Although the walk was a little tiring for some who were used to a more sedentary lifestyle in modern Singapore, it was a wonderful opportunity for students and teachers to interact in a setting totally different from the usual learning environment in the classroom. Throughout the journey, many were chatting away merrily, some were even heard crooning to their favourite tunes playing from their mobile phones. Amidst the cheery laughter and melodious singing, students and staff spent a beautiful morning exercising while bonding with one another. It was indeed a novel way to unwind from examination stress!
