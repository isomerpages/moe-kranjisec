### ‘Think, INquire in Kranji’ (THINK) for Sustainability Programme

As part of the ‘THINK for Sustainability Programme, Secondary 1 students embark on learning journeys to organisations known for their sustainability efforts such as Edible Garden City, Republic Polytechnic, Jewel @ Changi Airport and Creuse. Through these learning journeys, they gain inspiration on how industries are generating innovative green solutions to address pressing sustainable living issues. They then work on collaborative projects to ideate solutions for their chosen sustainable living issues during THINK lessons.
