The Student Leadership Challenge focuses on how student leaders get things done in organisation on their campuses and in their communities. The 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership model defines the behaviour that, when demonstrated with frequency, can bring about the best in themselves and those they aspire to lead.

Kranji Secondary School adopts the Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership Model (Leadership Challenge Model®). The Leadership Challenge Model®&nbsp;advocates that these five leadership practices are within the capacity of everyone to learn:

1.  Model the way
2.  Inspire a shared vision
3.  Challenge the process
4.  Enable others to act
5.  Encourage the heart

The following principles formed the cornerstone of the Kranji Student Leadership experience:

There is no substitute for hands-on experience that enable students to deepen their understanding as they put the practices into action. Kranjians in Secondary 1 and 3 will take The Student Leadership Practices Inventory (Student LPI), a comprehensive leadership development tool designed to help students measure their leadership behaviours and take action to improve their effectiveness as a leader. The Student LPI becomes an invaluable tool for guiding personal leadership development based on an assessment of a student’s current capacity to lead.

All in all, The Student Leadership Challenge is about how leaders see, inspire and achieve. It is about how we can liberate the leader within every Kranjian.
