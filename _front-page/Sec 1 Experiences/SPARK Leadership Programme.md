Started in 2023, SPARK (**S**tretching **P**otential, **A**spi**R**ing **K**ranjians) Leadership Programme is a leadership training programme for Secondary 1 students to expose them to the roles of Student Council (SC), Peer Support Leaders (PSL) and House Captains.

Due the differences in the nature of work between each student leadership body, the objectives of this programme are as follows:

*   Help students make an informed decision on which student leadership body they would like to be part of in subsequent years.
    
*   For teachers to assess suitability of students for each student leader body and make recommendations to students.

During one year-long programme, students under SPARK will undergo:

##### 1.  Job shadowing
Students will get a chance to join their seniors in the Student Council, Peer Support Leader and House Captains to plan for events. In doing so, students will gain understanding of the job scope of each of the student leadership bodies, and the skills and dispositions required.

##### 2.  Training
Students will be provided training to equip them with necessary skills. All students will be trained in basic peer support and project management skills.

##### 3.  Leadership Portfolio Management
Students under SPARK will also get a headstart in portfolio management. They will be taught how to create and manage their leadership portfolio. Teachers-in-charge will also guide them to reflect on their experiences after each training and job shadowing experiences.
