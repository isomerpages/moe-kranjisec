### Secondary One Orientation Programme

Student leaders, which comprises the Student Council, CCA Leaders, House Leaders and Peer Support Leaders plan and implement the Orientation Programme for all Secondary One students. Through this programme, Secondary One students are welcomed into the Kranji Family and are introduced to school practices and traditions, like the school song and the Kranji mass dance.

Orientation Group Leaders guide and mentor the Secondary One students throughout this programme, allowing them to forge new friendships and bonds with each other and know the school better.
