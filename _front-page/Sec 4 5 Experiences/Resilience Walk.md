One of the ‘rites of passage’ for our graduating cohort of students, the Wellness and Resilience Walk is an approximately 10 km hike for the Secondary 4 and 5 students before they embark on their National Examinations.

Besides being a great opportunity for class bonding and an avenue to manifest the value of resilience, the Wellness and Resilience Walk will bring our Kranjians along paths filled with nature and natural beauty. Through this refreshing walk, we hope our students are re-energised and are more motivated to maximise their effort to achieve the breakthrough in their results that they desire.
