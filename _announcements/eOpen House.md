##### **What is Full Subject Based Banding? How does this look like in Kranji Sec?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students. Kranji Sec introduced Full Subject Based Banding from 2022 onwards.

Sec 1 students will be grouped into mixed form classes, with each form class comprising students taking different courses (i.e. Express, N(A), and N(T) level). They will take the following subjects together as a form class – Art, Character and Citizenship Education, Design and Technology, Food and Consumer Education, Music, and Physical Education.

For PSLE subjects (English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, Science) and Humanities (History, Geography, Literature), Sec 1 students will be grouped and attend lessons according to their course (i.e. Express, N(A), or N(T) level).

##### **Does Kranji Sec offer Higher Mother Tongue (HMTL)?**
------------------------------------------------------

For Lower Sec students, Kranji Sec will offer HMTL (Higher Chinese, Higher Malay and Higher Tamil) from 2023 onwards. The lessons will be conducted in school.

Sec 1 students are eligible to take HMTL if they obtained:

\-        PSLE score of 8 or better, or

\-        PSLE score of 9-14 and attain AL1 or AL2 in MTL or Distinction/Merit in HMTL.

##### **What are the criteria for my child/ward to take a subject at a more demanding level from the start of Sec 1?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All secondary school students can offer English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One based on students' PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each subject.

Sec 1 students who offered English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and/or Science at Standard level at PSLE are eligible to take the subject at Express or N(A) level if they scored AL5 or better in that subject at PSLE. They are eligible to take the subject at N(A) level if they scored AL6.

Sec 1 students who offered English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and/or Science at Foundation level at PSLE are eligible to take the subject at N(A) level if they scored AL A.

##### **Can my child/ward take Humanities at a more demanding level?**
----------------------------------------------------------------

As Kranji Sec implements Full SBB, Sec 1 students who did well at the end of the year will be able to offer Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Sec 2. The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students' aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Sec 1.

##### **Will my child get a Personal Learning Device (PLD)?**
-------------------------------------------------------

Sec 1 students will receive a Personal Learning Device. Singaporean students can use their Edusave Account to pay for a PLD selected by the school. Students on MOE Financial Assistance Scheme will be provided with a subsidy to pay for PLD.
