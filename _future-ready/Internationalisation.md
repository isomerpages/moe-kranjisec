Internationalisation is an important thrust under MOE’s Learn for Life Agenda. The Internationalisation Programme is our school’s vehicle to provide our students with different opportunities to understand the histories, cultures, and economies of countries around the world, particularly those in Asia, and these countries’ interconnections with Singapore. The programme seeks to empower our youths with the networking and collaborative competencies and confidence to be advocates for regional and global issues.

### The Education for Sustainable Development Award – First Prize winner

The Education for Sustainable Development Award recognises education and learning that promotes sustainable development. In 2021, the theme was “Securing Educational Opportunities in COVID-19 Crisis” and we were one of the 282 schools from eight Southeast Asian countries which submitted entries for this award. Due to our strong internationalisation efforts, we were named the First Prize winner of the Education for Sustainable Development Award, which was presented by the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.

As the First Prize winner, our four student ambassadors embarked on a study trip to Tokyo, Japan in September 2023, which is an excellent opportunity for them to network with peers in Japan and have a deeper understanding of cross-cultural literacy and global awareness.

The Ministry of Education has featured our e-internationalisation programmes on schoolbag, a news website that provides parents, educators and the general public with education news, school features and tips. The article “The World is my Classroom” narrates our school’s approach in continuing to provide our students with an international experience despite the COVID-19 situation and the rich learning that student participants had obtained from this programme.

### ASEAN Symposium

One of our key internationalisation programmes is the ASEAN Symposium, which is conducted in partnership with the Institute of South East Asian Studies–ASEAN Studies Centre. It provides our students with a dialogue platform to discuss ASEAN-related issues with policymakers and academic representatives, and learn more about the opportunities and challenges facing ASEAN through case studies and research projects.

The 2022 Symposium theme was “The Future of ASEAN”. It aimed to engage today’s youth on the longstanding and current issues and challenges that ASEAN faces, and to propose solutions to overcome them. While ASEAN member states have made significant progress in attaining their United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), more needs to be done in areas such as environmental sustainability. The symposium therefore challenged students to work together to propose solutions for the future they envision for ASEAN. Over 700 students from 70 Secondary Schools attended the two-day virtual symposium. Students from our partner schools in the Philippines and Thailand also participated and shared rich and diverse perspectives on their countries’ efforts to achieve the UNSDGs.

### Virtual &amp; Physical School Exchanges

Our students participate in virtual school exchanges with schools in China, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Korea, spanning between six months and one year. Virtual exchanges have enabled our students to collaborate with peers from partner schools on projects relating to sustainability and STEM. Through synchronous and asynchronous interactions with peers from around the world, our students learn more about their cultures and collaborate on meaningful projects that enhance their global awareness and cross-cultural skills.

In 2023, our school resumed our physical overseas internationalisation trips as these trips provide students with important experiential touchpoints to gain exposure to the world around them, and to network and build strong ties with their overseas peers. In July, a group of students and staff visited Triam Udom Suksa Pattanakarn Suvarnabhumi School in Bangkok, Thailand. In October, another group of students and staff visited Tucheng Senior High School in Tainan, Taiwan. During these school exchanges, our students joined their foreign peers to showcase their projects, which were the fruits of their joint collaboration over the year. Students also participated in various cultural activities to deepen their understanding of local culture and socio-economic ties to Singapore.

This year, our school is expanding collaboration with partners from China, Indonesia, and Vietnam for virtual and physical exchanges to foster global perspectives, cultural understanding, and collaboration among students. Through these exchanges, students will have the opportunity to engage in meaningful cross-cultural interactions, develop interpersonal skills, and gain insights into different educational systems, languages, and traditions, preparing them as global citizens in an interconnected world.

In Semester One 2024, we had the pleasure of hosting three enriching school visits that fostered cultural exchange and mutual learning. In March, we welcomed staff and students from Trium Udom Suksa Pattanakarn Suvarnabhumi (TUPP), Bangkok, Thailand. Our students were thrilled to reconnect with their TUPP buddies, sharing lessons, cooking activities, and CCAs. The two schools presented their mini projects, enhancing their learning experiences through shared knowledge.

In May, we hosted students and teachers from Hangzhou Xingzhi Junior Middle School, China, providing an opportunity for both schools to engage in meaningful cultural exchanges. Their visit included school tours, classroom lessons, and participation in our Cross-cultural Immersion Programme, exploring Bunga Manggar Art and Rice Rangoli Art.

Additionally, we hosted 200 students from Seongnam Foreign Language High School, Korea, along with students from four other West Zone schools - Assumption English Sch, Bukit Panjang Government High, Chua Chu Kang Sec and Zhenghua Sec. This visit featured lessons on Singapore’s curriculum, cultural performances, traditional games, and an eco-trail exploration.

### Internationalisation Fair

The inaugural Internationalisation Fair was held in October 2023. The fair was put up by teachers and students participating in the various school exchange programmes with our partner schools in China, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand. This fair provided students who had previously participated in exchange programmes with the opportunity to synthesise and share their rich learning gleaned from these exchange programmes with their peers. Teachers also conducted sharing to broaden students’ exposure to different countries from around the world. Through the fair, students gained a deeper understanding of countries around the world and the intricate relationships that Singapore has with these countries.
