<p>Internationalisation is an important thrust under MOE’s Learn for Life
Agenda. The Internationalisation Programme is our school’s vehicle to provide
our students with different opportunities to understand the histories,
cultures, and economies of countries around the world, particularly those
in Asia, and these countries’ interconnections with Singapore. The programme
seeks to empower our youths with the networking and collaborative competencies
and confidence to be advocates for regional and global issues.</p>
<h3>The Education for Sustainable Development Award – First Prize winner</h3>
<p>The Education for Sustainable Development Award recognises education and
learning that promotes sustainable development. In 2021, the theme was
“Securing Educational Opportunities in COVID-19 Crisis” and we were one
of the 282 schools from eight Southeast Asian countries which submitted
entries for this award. Due to our strong internationalisation efforts,
we were named the First Prize winner of the Education for Sustainable Development
Award, which was presented by the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education
Organization (SEAMEO) and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science
and Technology, Japan.</p>

<p>As the First Prize winner, our four student ambassadors embarked on a
study trip to Tokyo, Japan in September 2023, which is an excellent opportunity
for them to network with peers in Japan and have a deeper understanding
of cross-cultural literacy and global awareness.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education has featured our e-internationalisation programmes
on schoolbag, a news website that provides parents, educators and the general
public with education news, school features and tips. The article “The
World is my Classroom” narrates our school’s approach in continuing to
provide our students with an international experience despite the COVID-19
situation and the rich learning that student participants had obtained
from this programme. Read the article <a href="https://www.schoolbag.edu.sg/story/the-world-in-my-classroom" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
<h3>ASEAN Symposium</h3>
<p>One of our key internationalisation programmes is the ASEAN Symposium,
which is conducted in partnership with the Institute of South East Asian
Studies–ASEAN Studies Centre. It provides our students with a dialogue
platform to discuss ASEAN-related issues with policymakers and academic
representatives, and learn more about the opportunities and challenges
facing ASEAN through case studies and research projects.</p>
<p>The 2022 Symposium theme was “The Future of ASEAN”. It aimed to engage
today’s youth on the longstanding and current issues and challenges that
ASEAN faces, and to propose solutions to overcome them. While ASEAN member
states have made significant progress in attaining their United Nations’
Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), more needs to be done in areas
such as environmental sustainability. The symposium therefore challenged
students to work together to propose solutions for the future they envision
for ASEAN. Over 700 students from 70 Secondary Schools attended the two-day
virtual symposium. Students from our partner schools in the Philippines
and Thailand also participated and shared rich and diverse perspectives
on their countries’ efforts to achieve the UNSDGs.</p>

<h3>Virtual &amp; Physical School Exchanges</h3>
<p>Our students participate in virtual school exchanges with schools in China,
Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Korea, spanning between six
months and one year. Virtual exchanges have enabled our students to collaborate
with peers from partner schools on projects relating to sustainability
and STEM. Through synchronous and asynchronous interactions with peers
from around the world, our students learn more about their cultures and
collaborate on meaningful projects that enhance their global awareness
and cross-cultural skills.</p>
<h5>International Youth Change Makers Exchange 2025</h5>
<p>In celebration of our 30th Anniversary, the 'Igniting Futures - International
Youth Change-Makers Exchange 2025' (IYCE2025) brought together youths,
aged 13 to 18, from Asia and Singapore to collaborate on addressing key
issues aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p>The event held online on the 4th of March 2025 brought over 250 participants
from local and overseas partner schools. After a warm welcome by our Principal,
Mr Chua who shared the objectives of the session , the guest speaker, Mr
Matin Mohdari, ASEAN Youth Fellow in 2022 and current Head of Public Policy,
Government and Corporate Affairs for Southeast and South Asia at Expedia
Group , kicked off the discussions with his inspiring talk on Youth and
Asia to the participants from local schools and countries like Philippines,
South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>The participants shared their plans on how their schools have been contributing
to help achieve the SDGs in creative and engaging ways using varied multimedia
forms and styles. This contributed to enriching conversations aimed towards
finding common solutions for challenges facing Asia. The session ended
with the Youth’s reflection and commitment to work towards the SDGs by
pledging to do their best to support them.</p>
<p>This exchange reflects our belief in youth empowerment and the role young
leaders play in driving social and environmental change. We hope that the
exchange has inspired the Kranjians’ and Youth participants to work together
to create a better Asia for their generation in the future.</p>

<p>In 2023, our school resumed our physical overseas internationalisation
trips as these trips provide students with important experiential touchpoints
to gain exposure to the world around them, and to network and build strong
ties with their overseas peers. In July, a group of students and staff
visited Triam Udom Suksa Pattanakarn Suvarnabhumi School in Bangkok, Thailand.
In October, another group of students and staff visited Tucheng Senior
High School in Tainan, Taiwan. During these school exchanges, our students
joined their foreign peers to showcase their projects, which were the fruits
of their joint collaboration over the year. Students also participated
in various cultural activities to deepen their understanding of local culture
and socio-economic ties to Singapore.</p>

<p>Exchange school programme in Taiwan and Thailand</p>
<p>This year, our school is expanding collaboration with partners from China,
Indonesia, and Vietnam for virtual and physical exchanges to foster global
perspectives, cultural understanding, and collaboration among students.
Through these exchanges, students will have the opportunity to engage in
meaningful cross-cultural interactions, develop interpersonal skills, and
gain insights into different educational systems, languages, and traditions,
preparing them as global citizens in an interconnected world.</p>
<p>In Semester One 2024, we had the pleasure of hosting three enriching school
visits that fostered cultural exchange and mutual learning. In March, we
welcomed staff and students from Trium Udom Suksa Pattanakarn Suvarnabhumi
(TUPP), Bangkok, Thailand. Our students were thrilled to reconnect with
their TUPP buddies, sharing lessons, cooking activities, and CCAs. The
two schools presented their mini projects, enhancing their learning experiences
through shared knowledge.</p>

<p>In May, we hosted students and teachers from Hangzhou Xingzhi Junior Middle
School, China, providing an opportunity for both schools to engage in meaningful
cultural exchanges. Their visit included school tours, classroom lessons,
and participation in our Cross-cultural Immersion Programme, exploring
Bunga Manggar Art and Rice Rangoli Art.</p>

and Zhenghua Sec. This visit featured lessons on Singapore’s curriculum,
cultural performances, traditional games, and an eco-trail exploration.</p>

<h3>Internationalisation Fair</h3>
<p>The inaugural Internationalisation Fair was held in October 2023. The
fair was put up by teachers and students participating in the various school
exchange programmes with our partner schools in China, Japan, the Philippines,
Taiwan and Thailand. This fair provided students who had previously participated
in exchange programmes with the opportunity to synthesise and share their
rich learning gleaned from these exchange programmes with their peers.
Teachers also conducted sharing to broaden students’ exposure to different
countries from around the world. Through the fair, students gained a deeper
understanding of countries around the world and the intricate relationships
that Singapore has with these countries.</p>
