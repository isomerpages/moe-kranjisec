<h2>Objectives of Programme</h2>
<p>When Student Initiated Learning (SIL) was first introduced in 2021, it
provided students with dedicated time and space during their fortnightly
Home-Based Learning (HBL) to explore their areas of interests by initiating
learning activities on their own.</p>
<p>Key purpose:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Encourage students to exercise self-directedness in their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore beyond the curriculum to pursue areas of passion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignite Joy of Learning in students&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inculcate a spirit of lifelong learning that will see students through
their adult-life</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Student Initiated Learning Activities</h3>
<p>The long-term goal of SIL was for students to fully initiate and carry
out their own learning activities. The school recognises studentsâ€™ project/task
through the Celebration of Learning at the end of each Semester.</p>

<h3>Celebration of Learning</h3>
<p>At the end of each semester, the school celebrates the SIL learning through
the celebration of learning via a talk show, where selected students share
or demonstrate their skills learnt through the semester or year with the
school.</p>

<p>This celebration embraces the resilience and growth mindset of our students
for their tenacity and trying to master a new skill or learning.</p>
