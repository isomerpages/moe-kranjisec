## Objectives of Programme

When Student Initiated Learning (SIL) was first introduced in 2021, it provided students with dedicated time and space during their fortnightly Home-Based Learning (HBL) to explore their areas of interests by initiating learning activities on their own.

Key purpose: 

*   Encourage students to exercise self-directedness in their learning
*   Explore beyond the curriculum to pursue areas of passion
*   Ignite Joy of Learning in students 
*   Inculcate a spirit of lifelong learning that will see students through their adult-life

### Student Initiated Learning Activities

School-curated SIL projects were crafted and monitored by teachers to help guide students for a start. Student-initiated with school facilitation allows students to explore SIL activities which require link-ups with an organisation and full SIL, where students pick up new skills and learning.

The long-term goal was for students to fully initiate and carry out their own learning activities. The school recognizes students’ project/task through the Celebration of Learning at the end of each Semester.

### Celebration of Learning

At the end of each semester, the school celebrates the SIL learning through the celebration of learning via peer presentation and a talk show, where students share or demonstrate their skills learnt through the semester or year.

This celebration embraces the resilience and growth mindset of our students for their tenacity and trying to master a new skill or learning.

**Student reflections**

> In my SIL journey, I have taught myself to get better at playing the guitar. Soon after I wanted to make use of my guitar skills, so I started songwriting and adding vocals! There are no limits to my learning!
