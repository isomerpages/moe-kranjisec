<p>The Applied Learning Programme allows students to develop a user-centric
lens in analysing authentic sustainable living issues, identify opportunities
for improvement and design creative solutions to address sustainability-related
issues. The ALP focus on sustainable living deepens students’ knowledge
of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) covered in the Singapore
Green Plan 2030, which have been broadly categorised into three broad areas
- Physical Environment, Resources and People. Through its myriad exciting
programmes, Kranji’s ALP serves to equip students with future-ready skills
while advancing Singapore’s national agenda on sustainable development.</p>

<h2>Key Programmes</h2>
<h4>Think, INquire in Kranji’ (THINK) for Sustainability Programme</h4>
<p>As part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and the Eco Stewardship Programme,
the THINK for Sustainability programme empowers our students to play their
part for the environment. Environment Action Weeks (EAW) held in Semester
1 help develop students’ understanding about various sustainability topics
beyond the curriculum, as well as get students to commit to the individual
roles they play in ensuring sustainable living and adopting sustainable
practices in real world contexts. In Term 2, the recycling of plastics
and food sustainability campaigns, Project Mottainai, organised in partnership
with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), were carried out for the school to
take positive steps for the environment in the areas of recycling and upcycling.
Both EAW and Project Mottainai comprised creative activities designed by
Green Ambassadors such as engaging morning assembly presentations, interactive
and gamified recess booths, a CCE lesson package featuring a talk show
with Professor Johannah Soo from the National Institute of Education (NIE)
on the topic of household food resilience, the “Bring Your Own Bottle”
week and Inter-House recycling competition.</p>

<p>Lower secondary students also complete the <em>THINK </em>&nbsp;programme
spanning across a period of one year. The explicit teaching of design thinking
process, critical thinking skills, research and information literacy skills
supports our students’ learning as they ideate solutions to tackle their
chosen sustainable living issues. Students also embark on learning journeys
to organisations such as Singapore Sustainable Gallery, Koh Fah Technology
Farm, Ento Industries and Creuse to gain inspiration on how industries
are generating innovative green solutions to address pressing sustainable
living issues. Their journey culminates in the THINK carnival, where students
present their project to their peers and juniors.</p>

<h4>Green Ambassador Programme</h4>
<p>Our Green Ambassadors are a group of students who have indicated interest
in leading and championing sustainability efforts in the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To empower our students as advocates for sustainable living, the Green
Ambassadors participated in the Housing and Development Board’s Friends
of Our Heartland Network. Through this program, they received training
in facilitation skills and became ambassadors for responsible and gracious
heartland living. As part of this initiative, they helped design and implement
the Limbang Eco Trail, promoting eco-conscious practices in partnership
with the Housing and Development Board. Under the guidance of ALP teachers,
the Green Ambassadors apply design thinking to plan and implement activities
that champion sustainability through the Environment Action Weeks and Project
Mottainai.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They contribute to biodiversity through the following programmes organised
in collaboration with the National Parks Board (NParks): (a) the Community
in Nature Ambassador (CIN) Programme where our Green Ambassadors lead in
efforts to conserve Singapore’s natural heritage at the Kranji Marshes,
and (b) the Greening Schools for Biodiversity Programme where our students
support environmental sustainability through the Million Trees project
as well as promote sustainable ecosystems with the development of a pollinator-friendly
habitat school garden. They also plant edible crops in our garden to support
Singapore in strengthening our food security. Beyond the school, Green
Ambassadors exercise their communication skills as they facilitate the
“Stewards of Tomorrow” workshop which educates primary school students
about biodiversity through activities such as a treasure hunt and garden
trail.</p>
