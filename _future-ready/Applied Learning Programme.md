<p>The Applied Learning Programme allows students to develop a user-centric
lens in analysing authentic sustainable living issues, identify opportunities
for improvement and design creative solutions to address sustainability-related
issues. The ALP focus on sustainable living deepens students’ knowledge
of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) covered in the Singapore
Green Plan 2030, which have been broadly categorised into three broad areas
- Physical Environment, Resources and People. Through its myriad exciting
programmes, Kranji’s ALP serves to equip students with future-ready skills
while advancing Singapore’s national agenda on sustainable development.</p>

<h2>Key Programmes</h2>
<h4>Think, INquire in Kranji’ (THINK) for Sustainability Programme</h4>
<p>As part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and the Eco Stewardship Programme,
the THINK for Sustainability programme empowers our students to play their
part for the environment. Environment Action Weeks (EAW) held in Semester
1 help develop students’ understanding about various sustainability topics
beyond the curriculum, as well as get students to commit to the individual
roles they play in ensuring sustainable living and adopting sustainable
practices in real world contexts. In Term 2, the recycling of plastics
and food sustainability campaigns, Project Mottainai, organised in partnership
with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), were carried out for the school to
take positive steps for the environment in the areas of recycling and upcycling.
Both EAW and Project Mottainai comprised creative activities designed by
Green Ambassadors such as engaging morning assembly presentations, interactive
and gamified recess booths, a CCE lesson package featuring a talk show
with Professor Johannah Soo from the National Institute of Education (NIE)
on the topic of household food resilience, the “Bring Your Own Bottle”
week and Inter-House recycling competition.</p>

<p>The Green Ambassadors also take part in the National Parks Board (NParks)
Greening Schools for Biodiversity Programme, where they support environmental
sustainability through the development of a pollinator-friendly habitat
in the school garden. The students also embarked on planting edible crops
in the garden to support Singapore in strengthening our food security.</p>
