#### Talent Development Roadmap

The school provides students with a Talent Development Roadmap that maps out the key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) that students could participate in, based on their strengths, areas for growth and interests as a Thinker, Leader and Champion (Kranjian Identity). The SDEs are tiered according to the levels of Discovery, Development and Distinction to cater to studentsâ€™ level of interest and aptitude. Students are also provided with details on the SDE, the participation pre-requisites, and the teachers-in-charge' contact details so that students can take the initiative in planning to meet their aspirations. This provides students with the autonomy to chart their own learning pathways throughout their time in the school

#### Talent Development Portfolio

Students are provided with a Talent Development Portfolio Guide comprising resources that enable and empower students to set goals, make plans, reflect on learning experiences and curate their portfolios. The school conducts training and provides regular opportunities for students to build up their portfolios, under the guidance of their Class Mentors. Students are encouraged to use their Talent Development Portfolios during their conversations with Class Mentors and in their application for aptitude-based admission to the Institutes of Higher Learning.

#### Mentoring

Students are mentored by Talent Development Committee teachers, who provide academic counselling, portfolio creation and education and career guidance.
