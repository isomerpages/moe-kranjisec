##### **Q1.&nbsp;What is the cut-off point to enter Kranji Secondary School?**

The cohort of Primary 6 pupils sitting for the PSLE from 2021 onwards will apply to secondary schools under a new PSLE scoring system.&nbsp; MOE has released the indicative entry and cut-off points for all secondary schools, based on simulated scores modelled on last year's PSLE scores.  
  
Based on last year's PSLE scores, the range of cut-off points would be 10-14 for Express, 21-23 for Normal (Academic), and 25-27 for Normal (Technical).&nbsp; Please note that the cut-off points may change based on the scores of the students who apply with this year's PSLE scores.
