### FAQs

##### **Q1. What is the cut-off point to enter Kranji Secondary School?**

The cohort of Primary 6 pupils sitting for the PSLE from 2021 onwards will apply to secondary schools under a new PSLE scoring system.  MOE has released the indicative entry and cut-off points for all secondary schools, based on simulated scores modelled on last year's PSLE scores.  
  
Based on last year's PSLE scores, the range of cut-off points would be 10-14 for Express, 21-23 for Normal (Academic), and 25-27 for Normal (Technical).  Please note that the cut-off points may change based on the scores of the students who apply with this year's PSLE scores.  
  
For more information on the new PSLE scoring system, you can refer to [https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/psle/main.html](https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/psle/main.html)
