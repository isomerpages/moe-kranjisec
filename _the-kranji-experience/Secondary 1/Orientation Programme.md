### Secondary One Orientation Programme

  
Student Councillors plan and implement the Orientation Programme for all Seocondary One students. Through this programme, Secondary One students are welcomed into our big Kranji Family and are introduced to school practices and traditions. Group facilitators who are also Student Councillors and Peer Support Leaders guide and mentor the Secondary One students throughout this Programme which culminates in the Secondary One Inauguration Ceremony.
