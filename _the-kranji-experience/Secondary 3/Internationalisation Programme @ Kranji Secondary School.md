### Internationalisation Programme @ Kranji Secondary School

Kranji Secondary School’s Internationalisation Programme aims to equip all Kranjians with a global perspective. With globalisation, the need to possess multi-cultural literacy becomes increasingly important. The driving force behind Kranji Secondary School’s Internationalisation Programme is the board concept of experiential and authentic learning. Through “The World is my Classroom” concept, the international exposure provides opportunities for our students to engage in real-world application of knowledge, skills and values. This structured reflective learning is in tandem with our school strategic thrust of Nurturing Future-Ready Leaders with a Heart to Serve vis-à-vis developing global awareness and cross-cultural skills in all Kranjians. It also allows our students to develop an awareness of where Singapore stands in the global arena, strengthen their commitment and rootedness to Singapore, and be better equipped to be ambassadors of the school and of Singapore.

  

The Internationalisation Programme is designed to equip every Kranjians with global perspectives and cross-cultural competency. This is done through various modes such as immersion programmes, educational expeditions, learning journeys, cross-cultural understanding and appreciation activities in Asia and beyond. Where possible, our students can engage with local people and be involved in their local community activities that further enrich their experiential learning.

  

Beyond KSS and with the passage of time, it is envisaged that our students will possess the relevant skills to interact and engage with a network of peers across geographical boundaries beyond their time in KSS.

  

In January 2020, we played host to our Internationalisation Programme partners – Xingzhi Secondary School from Hangzhou, China and Merlion School from Surabaya, Indonesia. The continued effort invested by Kranji Secondary School and our foreign school partners has enabled us to developing our students with a global perspective, deepen their cross cultural skills and experience authentic learning beyond geographical boundaries.
  

These hosting sessions at Kranji Secondary School is the second leg to our Internationalisation Programme, following our outbound first leg where Kranjians visited both schools in November 2019. The group of student ambassadors that hosted our visitors are the same group of students who were involved in the November school exchanges. Both groups of students were eager to reconnect with their buddies, and participate in various activities such as school orientation, lesson observations and a mosaic art lesson.
